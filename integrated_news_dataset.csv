Trump pleads not guilty to 34 felony counts,,https://edition.cnn.com/webview/politics/live-news/trump-indictment-stormy-daniels-news-04-03-23/index.html,,http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition.rss,rss,"What we covered hereFormer PresidentDonald Trumparrived in New York City Monday, a day before he is expected to turn himself in to law enforcement andface more than 30 criminal chargesin a Manhattan court following last week’s historic grand jury indictment.News outlets will not be allowedto broadcast the Tuesday arraignment, a judge ruled Monday night.Trump’s legal team said the former president will voluntarily surrender and will look tochallenge “every potential issue”once the indictment is unsealed.Trump, who has vowed to continue his 2024 bid, is the first current or former president in US history who has faced criminal charges. The district attorney’s officehas been investigatingTrump’s alleged role in a hush money payment scheme involving adult film star Stormy Daniels that dates to the 2016 presidential election. AllCatch Up34 PostsOur live coverage ofTrump’s historic indictment has moved.Link Copied!Trump arraignment has ""unparalleled public interest,"" but it won't be broadcast, judge saysFrom CNN's Tierney SneedActing New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan wrote his Monday night order that the media’s request to broadcast the arraignment of former President Donald Trump was understandable, but that the news organizations’ interests in providing the broadest possible access to the proceedings must be weighed against “competing interests.”In rejecting the request to broadcast the arraignment live on television, Merchan still wrote about the historical significance of the proceeding in stark terms.“That this indictment involves a matter of monumental significance cannot possibly be disputed. Never in the history of the United States has a sitting or past President been indicted on criminal charges. Mr. Trump’s arraignment has generated unparalleled public interest and media attention,” he wrote. “The populace rightly hungers for the most accurate and current information available. To suggest otherwise would be disingenuous.”Link Copied!Judge will only briefly allow photos in the courtroom before Trump arraignment beginsFrom CNN's Tierney SneedNews outlets will not be allowed to broadcast formerPresident Donald Trump’s arraignmenton Tuesday in a New York state court, a judge said Monday night, but he will allow some photographers to take pictures in the courtroom before the proceedings formally begin.Acting New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchanrejected the requestby several media organizations, including CNN, for permission to broadcast the historic proceedings. Trump’s arraignment — like most arraignments in the Manhattan courthouse — is a public proceeding, but news cameras are not usually allowed to broadcast from inside the courtroom.However, the judge is allowing five pool photographers to take still photos at the beginning of the proceedings “until such time as they are directed to vacate the jury box by court personnel.”Earlier on Monday, Trump’s lawyers urged the judge to reject the media’s request for live cameras in the courtroom. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office told the judge they didn’t have a position.The media outlets that tried to get cameras into the courtroom argued that “the gravity of this proceeding … and, consequently, the need for the broadest possible public access, cannot be overstated.”Trump is now in Manhattan ahead of the arraignment.A grand jury indicted the former presidentlast week.The arraignment is also expected to bring the unsealing of the criminal charges against Trump, which have not yet been seen by his lawyers or the public.The indictment stems from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’sinvestigationinto hush-money payments, made during the 2016 presidential campaign, to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies.Trump denies all wrongdoing and his lawyers said last week that they’ll fight toget the charges dropped.Link Copied!Tuesday is the first test for Trump to navigate a legal and political strategyFrom CNN's Jeff ZelenyDonald Trump is not planning to speak publicly in New York on Tuesday, aides say, if he follows advice from members of his legal team who have urged the former President to refrain from the vitriol he’s been directing toward theprosecutorandjudgepresiding over the case.But that restraint does not extend to Florida, aides said, where he is planning to deliver a full-throated defense of his New York case as well asother investigations he is facingduring a prime time address from Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday night.It’s the first test to see whether Trump can navigate two vasty different approaches to hislegal caseand hispolitical campaign, which are now inextricably linked.“He’s taking this very seriously and following legal advice,” an adviser to Trump said Monday night. “He will make his case to Americans Tuesday night at Mar-a-Lago.”Link Copied!Trump is ""ready to go in and do what he needs to do tomorrow,"" attorney saysFrom CNN's Mary Kay MalloneeAlina Habba, lawyer for

We expect that they will behave professionally. But we also expect that they will use their seat to spread disinformation and to promote their own agenda as it relates to Ukraine, and we will stand ready to call them out at every single moment that they attempt to do that,” Greenfield added.Greenfield said she is not surprised if the Russians asked the foreign minister to come to UNSC headquarters in New York but also said council does work beyond Ukraine.“We haven’t decided yet on what our attendance levels will be, but we intend to carry out the business of the Security Council during this month. The Security Council does more than Ukraine. We work on many issues, and we again expect that Russia will carry their presidency in a professional way, but when they don’t, we will stand ready to call them out,” Greenfield said.Link Copied!Finland to be inducted into NATO and Russia pushes back on UN Security presidency concerns.

That raises questions about whether there is intelligence the balloon was able to gather that the US still doesn’t know about.Still, the intelligence community has not been overly concerned about the information the balloon was able to gather, the person said, because it is not much more sophisticated than what Chinese satellites are able to glean as they orbit over similar locations.A US intelligence official told CNN on Monday that “although analysis of the wreckage of the High Altitude Balloon remains ongoing, thus far, its flight over the United States does not appear to have provided critical new insights to the People’s Republic of China.”The US also knew what the balloon’s path would be and was able to protect sensitive sites and censor some signals before the balloon was able to pick them up,officials have said.As CNN has reported, the US intelligence community last yeardeveloped a method of trackingwhat it says is a fleet of these Chinese balloons operating across the globe, controlled by the Chinese military.The FBI is still examining the balloon, but so far officials have been able to glean additional information about how the device worked, including the algorithms used for the balloon’s software and how it is powered and designed.CNN has reached out to the National Security Council at the White House and the Pentagon for comment. NBC wasfirst to reporton the new intelligence.Video Ad FeedbackJustin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats01:33- Source:CNNJustin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats01:33The balloon first crossed into US airspace over Alaska in late January before passing through Canada and down into Montana, where it hovered for a few days, leading the US to believe it was trying to surveil sensitive military sites, like Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. It waseventually shot downby the US off the East Coast on February 4, and the incident further escalated tensions between Washington and Beijing, including the postponement of a diplomatic visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China.A senior State Department official said in February that, as the balloon floated across the US, it “was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations.”Gen. Glen VanHerck, the commander of US Northern Command and NORAD, said at the time that the US “did not assess” that the balloon “presented a significant collection hazard beyond what already exists in actionable technical means from the Chinese.”The surveillance program, which includes a number of similar balloons, is in part run out of the small Chinese province of Hainan, officials told CNN. The US does not know the precise size of the fleet of Chinese surveillance balloons, but sources tell CNN that the program has conducted at least two dozen missions over at least five continents in recent years.Roughly half a dozen of those flights have been within US airspace, although not necessarily over US territory, according to one official familiar with the intelligence.China has maintained that the balloon was actually just a weather balloon thrown off course, and the US has been assessing the possibility that it was not deliberately maneuvered into the continental US by the Chinese government, CNN hasreported.Still, China did maintain some ability to maneuver the balloon, officials believe. And once the balloon was over Montana, China appeared to take advantage of its position to loiter over sensitive sites and try to collect intelligence.This story has been updated with additional reporting.CNN’s Alex Marquardt contributed to this report.",unknown,2025-08-04T13:29:01.303323,sailor suspect chines high altitud surveil balloon down unit state territori water coast myrtl beach south carolina februari fleet forc navi reuterswashingtoncnn thechines spi transit year abl captur imageri collect signal intellig militari site sourc familiar matter tell balloon abl transmit inform beij real time sourc govern know sure chines govern wipe balloon data receiv rais question intellig balloon abl gather know intellig commun concern inform balloon abl gather person sophist chines satellit abl glean orbit similar locat intellig offici monday analysi wreckag high altitud balloon remain ongo flight unit state appear provid critic new insight peopl republ china knew balloon path abl protect sensit site censor signal balloon abl pick offici report intellig commun last yeardevelop method fleet chines balloon oper globe control chines militari fbi examin balloon offici abl glean addit inform devic work includ algorithm use balloon softwar power design reach nation secur council white hous pentagon comment wasfirst reporton new intellig video feedbackjustin trudeau world need handl china threat sourc cnnjustin trudeau world need handl china threat balloon cross airspac alaska late januari pass canada montana hover day lead believ tri sensit militari site malmstrom air forc base montana shot downbi east coast februari incid escal tension washington beij includ postpon diplomat visit secretari state antoni blinken china senior state depart offici februari balloon float capabl conduct signal intellig collect oper gen glen vanherck command northern command norad time assess balloon present signific collect hazard exist action technic mean chines surveil program includ number similar balloon part run small chines provinc hainan offici know precis size fleet chines surveil balloon sourc tell program conduct dozen mission least contin recent year dozen flight airspac territori offici familiar intellig china maintain balloon balloon thrown cours assess possibl maneuv continent chines govern hasreport china maintain abil maneuv balloon offici believ balloon montana china appear take advantag posit sensit site tri collect intellig stori updat addit report alex marquardt contribut,"{""word_count"": 679, ""char_count"": 4315, ""sentence_count"": 9, ""avg_word_length"": 5.915625, ""vocabulary_richness"": 0.6125, ""most_common_words"": [[""balloon"", 20], [""chines"", 9], [""intellig"", 9], [""abl"", 8], [""offici"", 7], [""china"", 7], [""state"", 4], [""collect"", 4], [""site"", 4], [""sourc"", 4]]}",679,9,0.6125
Beijing promised to 'fight back' over Taiwan leader's US visit. But this time it has more to lose,An anticipated meeting between Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen and US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in California this week has sparked concerns of a repeat of the pressure campaign China launched last year when then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taipei.,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/04/asia/tsai-ing-wen-taiwan-mccarthy-meeting-analysis-intl-hnk/index.html,"Tue, 04 Apr 2023 07:49:53 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition.rss,rss,"Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen waves as she arrives at a hotel in New York during a stopover on Thursday, March 30, 2023 a day before flying to Central America.John Minchillo/APHong KongCNN—Ananticipated meetingbetween Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen and US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in California this week has sparked concerns of a repeat of the pressure campaignChinalaunched last year when then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taipei.At that time, Beijingencircled the island democracywith unprecedented military drills – firing multiple missiles into its surrounding waters and sending dozens of warplanes speeding across a sensitive median line dividing the Taiwan Strait.It alsocut off contactwith the United States over a number of issues from military matters to combating climate change, in retaliation for what it viewed as a violation of its sovereignty.This time, Beijing has already threatened to “resolutely fight back” if a Tsai-McCarthy meeting goes ahead.Video Ad FeedbackSee why tensions are rising between US and China over Taiwan02:32- Source:CNNSee why tensions are rising between US and China over Taiwan02:32It also slammed Washington for allowing Tsai to stopover in the US while en route to and from official visits in Central America, warning it could lead to“serious” confrontationbetween the two powers.Adefiant Tsaistaked out her own ground, pledging as she took off on her 10-day trip not to let “external pressure” stop Taiwan from connecting with the world and like-minded democracies.But the optics of the meeting, taking place in California and not Taiwan, and its timing – at a particularly thorny moment in China’s foreign relations andahead of a presidential election in Taiwan that could reset the tone of its relationship with Beijing – may see Beijing tread more carefully this time, or at least not escalate further, analysts say.“This puts the burden on China not to overreact, because any overreaction is only going to push China further away from the world,” said Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Stimson Center think tank in Washington.That doesn’t mean, however, that Beijing won’t be closely watching Tsai’s movements as it calibrates its response – and decides how much military might to flex over her meeting with an American lawmaker on American soil.The opacity of China’s system – and the potential for competing interests within its vast bureaucracy – also make it difficult to accurately predict its response.“Every time Taiwan does anything that China doesn’t like, the Chinese react with their own military coercion,” Sun said. But in the current situation, “they have to consider the consequences of overreaction,” she added.House Speaker Kevin McCarthy talks to reporters at the Capitol in Washington on March 24, 2023.J. Scott Applewhite/APRising pressureThe expected meeting, which McCarthy’s officeannouncedearlier this week would take place on Wednesday, also comes at a precarious moment in US-China relations.Washington and Beijing are struggling to stabilize their communicationamid flaring tensions over issues from a downedsuspected Chinese surveillance balloontosemiconductor supply chains– raising the stakes of potential damage to that relationship if Beijing lashes out as it did when Tsai met Pelosi.Taiwan is still feeling the fallout of that response last August, with Chinese military forces now regularly making incursions over what had previously been an informal but largely respected border of control between Beijing and Taipei in the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan’s official Central News Agency also reported Monday that Tsai would meet with McCarthy, citing Tsai’s presidential office.Video Ad FeedbackSee image of a Chinese balloon hovering over Taiwan03:05- Source:CNNSee image of a Chinese balloon hovering over Taiwan03:05But a meeting between Tsai and the leader of the Republican majority in the US House of Representatives, who ranks second in line to the Presidency, would mark another symbolic moment for Taiwan and the US, which only maintain unofficial ties.For Tsai, who is entering the final year of her two-term presidency, “it’s clearly a capstone event,” according to Wen-Ti Sung, a political scientist at the Australian National University’s Taiwan Studies Program. “She has this image as the Taiwanese president who has taken US-Taiwan relations to new heights, and who … has been able to give Taiwan almost unprecedented international visibility,” he said.That increased visibility – and enhanced cooperation with the US – has followed China’s mounting pressure on the island, which sits fewer than 110 miles (177 kilometers) from the mainland coast.China’s Communist Party claims the self-governing island democracy as its own despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to take the island, by force if necessary.The flags of Taiwan and Honduras flutter in the wind outside the Taiwan Embassy in Tegucigalpa, Honduras March 15, 2023.

Could you be owed car finance compensation? Here's how to check,A court ruling could lead to millions claiming compensation over being mis-sold car finance deals.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr4e2d09wdko?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Mon, 04 Aug 2025 14:32:26 GMT",http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml,rss,"Could I get car finance compensation?4 hours agoShareSaveLucy HookerBusiness reporter, BBC NewsShareSaveGetty ImagesIf you used car finance to buy a vehicle any time in the last 18 years, you could be in line for compensation.It follows a recent court ruling on hidden commissions that lenders paid to dealers, which opens the door for potential payouts to millions, if they are found to have been mis-sold finance.If you are eligible, you are still in for a bit of a wait, and for now the advice is not to sign up with a claims company promising to help you get redress, because it won't speed things up and they will charge a fee.But there are a few other things to bear in mind, if you are trying to work out whether you are likely to get compensation.Am I eligible?Most car buyers use motor finance, borrowing money and paying ininstalments over time.Car dealers almost always receive a payment for their part in arranging the loan - a commission.A Supreme Court ruled that many of these commission payments were legal, but in certain circumstances the failure by dealers to properly disclose details of the charges could be unfair and therefore unlawful.The ruling narrowed the scope of redress set by lower courts, which would have allowed claims for compensation from many more car buyers.The key is whether customers were treated ""fairly"", although the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), is still working on exactly what that will mean.One specific group of buyers who are likely to be eligible are people who took out car loans that included discretionary commission arrangements (DCAs). They were banned in 2021 but prior to that lenders gave car dealers leeway to charge higher interest and earn a percentage of that as commission. Customers who had DCAs and were overcharged as a result are likely to have a claim.If you still have your contract you can check the terms and conditions.How much is too much?The Supreme Court ruled in a test case that one car buyer, Marcus Johnson, should be entitled to compensation, setting a reference point for future cases.Mr Johnson told the court he was presented with ""an enormous amount of paperwork"". He didn't read it all and signed, trusting the sales representative to talk him through the deal.But 55% of the interest he was paying on the car was commission, which the judge deemed unreasonable.Anyone paying commission at that level is likely to be eligible for compensation, but it remains to be seen how much lower rates would have to be, to count as fair, ruling a customer out of the right to compensation.Car finance judgement 'a hard pill to swallow'Car finance payouts have been limited, but lenders aren't off the hookThe judge also referred to Mr Johnson's lack of ""sophistication"" when it came to financial matters. He was a young driver, with little experience.Most of us feel a bit bamboozled by a car showroom, with the hard-sell tactics and unfamiliar jargon, points out Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell.""It feels incredibly pressured,"" she says. And most people don't fully understand the deal they are signing up to, which often include ""balloon payments"", backloading the payment at the end of the contract.""For a lot of people it will feel unfair,"" she says. But just because you would like to claw back some of the money you've paid, doesn't mean you will get anything.What about the small print?Part of the debate around whether car buyers should be compensated revolves around whether customers had given ""informed consent"" for commission payments.The details of any financial arrangement including commission must be included in the terms and conditions. But many people do not read the T&Cs, especially if there is time pressure, and someone is dangling a set of brand new car keys in front of them.Mr Johnson admitted he hadn't.But the Supreme Court ruled that the key elements of the contract were not given enough prominence.So even if all the details - including commission arrangements - were there in your contract, if they weren't highlighted in a separate box or in bold, you might be eligible for compensation, says Alex Neill, co-founder of charity Consumer Voice.If I think I am eligible, what do I do?The FCA is setting up a compensation scheme. In October it will launch a six week consultation over how it should work, with the first payments expected to come in 2026.So you can just wait until the scheme is available.Alternatively,the FCA suggestswriting to your lenderto establish the facts of your own case.Lenders must acknowledge your complaint within eight weeks, and by submitting a complaint at this stage you may get an indication of how likely you are to receive any redress, says Ms Neill.If you cannot remember the name of the lender involved the car dealership should be able to help you, she says.Consumer groups and the FCA advise against signing up with a claims company.

It is used by media and spectators alike.In the hours after thesensational fifth Test between England and Indiaended, with the ground emptying, on that staircase was found a left shoe, then some underwear, then a right shoe.Because of their size, they presumably belonged to a man. Quite how the owners misplaced them, or when they realised their loss, is unclear. However, it raises the prospect that someone left this famous old ground both shoeless and pantless.It would have been entirely in keeping with the mayhem that had already played out on Monday morning.There had been 57 minutes of the most intense, dramatic and emotional sport you could ever wish to see.Twenty-five days of gripping Test cricket came down to a one-armed man painfully scampering 22 yards of south London turf. One wonders how the productivity of the UK was affected at the beginning of the working week, or how many offices in Mumbai, Kolkata and Bengaluru closed early.There had been an element of farce to the previous evening. Players went to the dressing rooms because of rain and bad light when the game was on a knife-edge, then stayed there as the gloom turned to evening sunshine.Any frustration over the events of Sunday turned into anticipation of what might be possible on Monday. Thirty-five runs or four wickets. The Oval was sold out, but would anyone bother to turn up?Turn up they did, filling this historic venue with constant noise and nervous energy. There were echoes of the2005 Ashes classic in Birmingham, when Edgbaston was full for what might have only been two deliveries of action. Just like then, there was a rich reward for turning up. India's six-run win here is the narrowest of its kind in this country since England beat Australia by two runs 20 years ago.England-India Test series best since 2005 Ashes - AgnewPublished5 hours agoWho pressed their Ashes case? Who disappointed? England's player ratingsPublished3 hours agoIndia win all-time classic despite Woakes heroicsPublished6 hours agoIndia began the day with a huddle that seemed to have every member of the touring party included. Security, chef, bus driver. England, naturally, played football.Fittingly, it was Surrey v England. When Jamie Overton took fours off each of the first two balls of the day, England had almost a quarter of the runs they required. It was the best it got.Jamie Smith has looked increasingly frazzled in his first five-Test series as a wicketkeeper. He wafted at two deliveries, then edged the third. The dhol drum of the Bharat Army beat out the rhythm of We Will Rock You, and rocked England were. When Overton was struck on the pad, umpire Kumar Dharmasena paid his own 2005 tribute with the slow finger of Rudi Koertzen.Josh Tongue had a scattergun game with the ball and found himself as the last line of defence before the stricken Chris Woakes.On Sunday evening, Woakes somehow folded his dislocated shoulder into a set of cricket whites, which sounds excruciatingly painful in itself. When Tongue had his stumps rearranged by Prasidh Krishna, security staff rushed on to the outfield, believing the match to be over. They had not been briefed that Woakes, the nicest man in cricket, is also the bravest.To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption,'Here he comes!' - Woakes comes out to bat with arm in slingEarlier this year, Woakes had a tattoo inked on his left tricep in memory of his late father Roger, who died last year. Now the same arm was strapped under his England sweater as he descended the pavilion stairs, putting his broken body on the line for the Three Lions on his chest.History will remember Woakes as a World Cup winner in both formats, an Ashes winner and one of the finest seamers in English conditions. This will trump them all. The Wizard will always be the man who tried to help England win a Test with only one functioning arm.How painful it must have been for Woakes to run three times between the wickets, his shoulder jolted by every step. Mercifully, he never faced a delivery. While Woakesplayed Jack Leach, Gus Atkinson could not ape Ben Stokes. Atkinson was bowled attempting to hit the six that would have levelled the scores and won the series.According to Stokes, Woakes' reaction in the dressing room was to ""shrug his shoulder"", which is probably the last thing he should have done.To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption,'England panicked' - Vaughan on fifth Test ",unknown,2025-08-04T13:29:01.303323,india provid intens dramat emot final play video need enabl javascript browser video playedmedia caption india win dramat final test run clinch seri drawstephan shemiltchief cricket report kia ovalpublish hour commentsinsid finn stand oval opposit pavilion staircas lead test match special commentari box use media spectat hour thesens fifth test england indiaend ground empti staircas found left shoe underwear right shoe size belong man quit owner misplac realis loss unclear rais prospect someon left famou old ground shoeless pantless keep mayhem play monday morn minut intens dramat emot sport wish see day grip test cricket came arm man scamper yard south london turf wonder product affect begin work week mani offic mumbai kolkata bengaluru close earli element farc previou even player went dress room rain bad light game knife edg stay gloom turn even sunshin frustrat event sunday turn anticip possibl monday thirti run wicket oval sold anyon bother turn turn fill histor venu constant nois nervou energi echo ash classic birmingham full deliveri action rich reward turn india run kind countri england beat australia run year england india test seri ash agnewpublish hour agowho press ash case disappoint england player ratingspublish hour win time classic woak heroicspublish hour agoindia began day huddl seem member tour parti includ secur chef bu driver england play footbal surrey england jami overton took four first ball day england quarter run requir got jami smith look frazzl test seri waft deliveri edg third dhol drum bharat armi beat rhythm rock rock england overton struck pad umpir kumar dharmasena paid tribut slow finger rudi koertzen josh tongu scattergun game ball found last line defenc stricken chri woak sunday even woak fold disloc shoulder set cricket white sound pain tongu stump rearrang prasidh krishna secur staff rush believ match brief woak man cricket play video need enabl javascript browser video playedmedia caption come woak come bat arm slingearli year woak tattoo ink left tricep memori roger die last year arm strap england sweater descend pavilion stair put broken bodi line lion chest histori rememb woak world cup winner format ash seamer english condit trump wizard man tri help england win test function arm pain woak run time wicket jolt step face deliveri woakesplay jack leach gu atkinson ape ben stoke atkinson bowl attempt hit level score seri stoke woak reaction dress room shrug shoulder last thing done play video need enabl javascript browser video playedmedia caption england panick vaughan fifth test,"{""word_count"": 835, ""char_count"": 5000, ""sentence_count"": 29, ""avg_word_length"": 5.330864197530865, ""vocabulary_richness"": 0.6864197530864198, ""most_common_words"": [[""england"", 11], [""woak"", 9], [""test"", 8], [""video"", 6], [""run"", 6], [""play"", 5], [""hour"", 5], [""turn"", 5], [""india"", 4], [""seri"", 4]]}",835,29,0.6864197530864198

Farage calls on police to share immigration status of charged suspects,The plea comes after two men were charged in connection with the alleged rape of a 12-year-old girl in Warwickshire.,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c860py73pglo?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Mon, 04 Aug 2025 17:32:17 GMT",http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml,rss,"Farage calls on police to share immigration status of charged suspects56 minutes agoShareSaveAlys DaviesBBC NewsShareSaveEPA/ShutterstockNigel Farage has called on the police to release the immigration status of suspects charged with crimes following the arrest of two men in connection with the alleged rape of a 12-year-old girl in Warwickshire.The Reform UK party leader said he ""absolutely"" thinks such details should be released when asked about the matter at a news conference on Monday.It has been reported that the two men charged in connection with the alleged rape in Nuneaton last month are Afghan nationals but the police have not confirmed this.Warwickshire Police said once someone is charged with an offence, the force follows national guidance that does not include sharing ethnicity or immigration status.The authorised professional practice followed by forces across the country, and cited by the College of Policing, says the same.Asked by a reporter at the news conference in Westminster whether police should release the names, addresses and immigration statuses of suspects after they have been charged with a crime, Farage said: ""What caused unrest on our streets after Southport last year was us not being told the status of the attacker.""That led to crazy conspiracy theories spreading online.""Last year'sdeadly attack in Southport, in which three young girls were murdered, led to the spreading of a false claim online that the attacker was a Muslim asylum seeker.Linking a perceived lack of information from police about Nuneaton to what happened in Southport last July, Farage continued: ""To have masses of speculation as to what might have happened makes things I think far worse than they otherwise would be"".Asked to clarify his thoughts further on whether he thought police forces should be obliged to publish such details, he said: ""Yes, I absolutely think that they should.""Later in the news conference, Farage called the police's decision not to release details about the alleged Nuneaton attackers a ""cover-up that in many ways is reminiscent of what happened after the Southport killings last year.""""It is not... in any way at all a contempt of court for the British public to know the identity of those who allegedly have committed serious crimes,"" he added.""I felt that in the wake of the Southport attacks, and I feel that ever more strongly today.""I regret taking my son to a riot following Southport attack, says stepmotherHow Southport is trying to heal, one year onAhmad Mulakhil has been charged with two counts of rape, while Mohammad Kabir has been accused of kidnap, strangulation and aiding and abetting the rape of a girl aged under 13.Mr Mulakhil, 23, appeared before magistrates in Coventry on 28 July, while Mr Kabir, also 23, appeared in court on Saturday.Both were remanded in custody.Leader of Warwickshire County Council George Finch told the same news conference on Monday morning that he was ""begging"" for information to be released following the charges.Finch, who at 19 became the youngest council leader in the UK and represents Reform UK, said he had contacted the chief executive of the council, Monica Fogarty, saying he wished to speak to Warwickshire Police ""to urge"" them to release the immigration status of the first man charged.""I was begging for this to be released, screaming, phoning, asking [for the information] to be released"", he said.Following the charging of the second suspect, Finch said he wrote a letter addressed to Home Secretary Yvette Cooper and Warwickshire Police's Chief Constable Alex Franklin-Smith calling for the immediate release of the two suspects' details.Finch published the letter on his social media accounts on Sunday, in which he said Ms Fogarty had told him that Mr Kabir was an asylum seeker living in a house of multiple occupancy (HMO).Speaking on Monday, Finch said he would be working to ""fight against"" houses of multiple occupancy that ""have been put up to house illegal immigrants"".He also claimed Reform UK needed to ""change things"" and are ""the last line of defence against the blob, the cover-ups of the councils"".When asked if police should release the ethnicity of people charged with offences, the prime minister's official spokesman said the police and courts were operationally independent but the principle was to be ""as transparent as possible"".""We've always said and continue to say that transparency is important,"" he said.""That is our position. For police up to central government, we should always be as transparent as possible when it comes to cases.""He added: ""This is clearly a deeply upsetting and distressing case which the public are right to feel shocked and angry about.""In relation to this case, the individuals have been charged and we are now in a live investigation.""In a statement, Warwickshire Police and Crime Commissioner Philip Seccombe said: ""It is essential to state that policing decisions - such as whether to release details about a suspect - must fol",unknown,2025-08-04T13:29:01.303323,farag call polic share immigr statu charg suspect minut agosharesaveali daviesbbc newssharesaveepa shutterstocknigel farag call polic releas immigr statu suspect charg crime follow arrest men connect alleg rape year old girl warwickshir reform parti leader think detail releas ask confer report men charg connect alleg rape nuneaton last month afghan nation polic confirm warwickshir polic someon charg offenc forc follow nation guidanc includ share ethnic immigr statu authoris profession practic follow forc countri cite colleg polic ask report confer westminst polic releas name address immigr status suspect charg crime farag caus unrest street southport last year statu attack led crazi conspiraci theori spread onlin last year attack southport young girl murder led spread fals claim onlin attack muslim asylum seeker link perceiv lack inform polic nuneaton happen southport last juli farag continu mass specul happen make thing think ask clarifi thought thought polic forc oblig publish detail ye think confer farag call polic decis releas detail alleg nuneaton attack cover mani way reminisc happen southport kill last year way contempt court british public know ident commit seriou crime ad felt wake southport attack feel today regret take son riot follow southport attack stepmotherhow southport tri heal year onahmad mulakhil charg count rape mohammad kabir accus kidnap strangul aid abet rape girl age mulakhil appear magistr coventri juli kabir appear court saturday remand custodi leader warwickshir counti council georg finch confer monday morn beg inform releas follow charg finch becam council leader repres reform contact chief execut council monica fogarti say wish speak warwickshir polic urg releas immigr statu man charg beg releas scream phone ask inform releas follow charg second suspect finch wrote letter address home secretari yvett cooper warwickshir polic chief constabl alex franklin smith call immedi releas suspect detail publish letter social media account sunday fogarti kabir asylum seeker live hous multipl occup hmo speak monday finch work fight hous multipl occup put hous illeg immigr claim reform need chang thing last line defenc blob cover up council ask polic releas ethnic peopl charg offenc prime minist offici spokesman polic court independ principl transpar possibl continu transpar import posit polic central govern transpar possibl come case ad upset distress case public right feel shock angri relat case individu charg live investig statement warwickshir polic crime commission philip seccomb essenti state polic decis releas detail suspect fol,"{""word_count"": 797, ""char_count"": 5000, ""sentence_count"": 14, ""avg_word_length"": 5.695876288659794, ""vocabulary_richness"": 0.5515463917525774, ""most_common_words"": [[""polic"", 16], [""charg"", 11], [""releas"", 11], [""southport"", 7], [""immigr"", 6], [""suspect"", 6], [""follow"", 6], [""warwickshir"", 6], [""last"", 6], [""attack"", 6]]}",797,14,0.5515463917525774

To address this issue, he's providing his community with a new way to stay connected.Schlott has taken old pay phones, modified them to make free calls, and set them up in three different towns across the county.

In one, Evyatar David says he is digging his own grave and speaks of days without food. In the other, Rom Braslavski writhes in agony on a dirty mattress and says injuries in his foot prevent him from being able to stand.The Associated Press does not normally publish videos of hostages filmed under duress, but is publishing brief excerpts after receiving consent from their families.Sponsor MessageThe videos led tens of thousands of Israelis to take to the streets on Saturday night and demand a ceasefire deal, in one of the largest turnouts for the weekly protests in recent months.""In this new video, his eyes are extinguished. He is helpless, and so am I,"" Braslavski's mother, Tami, said in a statement.Warnings of famine in GazaThe videos were released as warnings about famine among Palestinians are growing in Gaza. Images of starving Palestinians have drawn international condemnation of Israeli policies limiting aid deliveries into the territory.Families of the hostages fear that the lack of food threatens the remaining hostages, too. Fewer than half of the 50 hostages are believed to be alive.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was shocked by the images of the two hostages and met with the Red Cross to ask that it bring hostages food and medicine — access that the organization says it has never been granted by Hamas.""When I see these, I understand exactly what Hamas wants,"" Netanyahu said on Sunday. ""They do not want a deal. They want to break us using these videos of horror.""Middle East conflictFrance, U.K., others plan to recognize a Palestinian state. What does that change?Netanyahu said the videos renewed his determination to release the hostages and eliminate Hamas.

Last week, the Labor Department reported that thejob market weakened sharply duringthe late spring and early summer as President Trump's tariffs began to take effect.

The employees said they are now receiving hourly wages but have not been paid for the work they were asked to do as volunteers while they waited to be put on the federal payroll.Some of the workers said they feel exploited.""It's definitely taking advantage of people who love their jobs and don't want the park to suffer,"" said one of the employees, who said they volunteered for three weeks before being hired.Sponsor MessageNPR spoke with four seasonal and two full-time workers employed by the National Park Service who described the situation. NPR has agreed not to publish the names of the employees because they are not permitted to speak publicly and feared retribution.Yosemite depends on seasonal workers to perform a variety of jobs from May through October, when the park receives most of the more than 4 million visitors who typically enter the grounds. The national park, located near Mariposa, Calif., is one of the most visited in America.At Yosemite, seasonal workers do ""anything from campgrounds operations, to wilderness permitting for backpackers, to the seasonal interpretive rangers, seasonal maintenance staff,"" said Jesse Chakrin, the executive director of The Fund for People in Parks, a nonprofit that advocates for national parks. The National Park Service hires thousands of seasonal workers a year across America. More than 100 are typically hired annually at Yosemite early in the busy season, Chakrin said.But 2025 was no typical year. On Feb. 14, 10 full-time federal employees at Yosemite were fired when the federal government terminated about 1,000 newly hired employees throughout the National Park Service. In the weeks that followed, additional experienced workers left the park service voluntarily. Since January, the amount of permanent staff across the service has declined by 24%, according to dataanalyzedin July by the National Parks Conservation Association, a nonprofit that defends parks.Sponsor MessageThen, after staff members were fired in February, some were hired back. That meant the park service's already straining Human Resources division had to take on additional work to bring those people into the workforce again, federal workers told NPR. Around late spring, when more visitors started entering the park and seasonal workers began arriving at Yosemite to start their jobs, Human Resources wasn't able to onboard all the seasonal staff, Yosemite employees said.""We had the firing of probationary employees in February and then the rehiring, and this was a huge, huge burden on Human Resources to try to get people in and out,"" said Emily Thompson, the executive director of the Coalition to Protect America's National Parks, a nonprofit that supports workers at parks. ""And seasonal hiring was delayed.""But Yosemite still needed seasonal workers. An Aprilorder from the Department of the Interior, the agency that oversees the National Park Service, said all parks should stay open as usual in 2025, with changes to operating hours requiring special approval.Seasonal workers needed the jobs, too. Many count on their employment at the park to provide them with housing. Because some parts of Yosemite are located dozens of miles from the nearest city, accommodations at the park are typically offered to people who work there, for a fee.""They're dependent upon their job to have a home,"" said Chakrin.On May 18, visitors took photos at a viewing point above Vernal Fall, a waterfall at Yosemite National Park.Chiara Eisner/NPRhide captiontoggle captionChiara Eisner/NPRIn other parks, seasonal employees weren't hired at all.  As of July, only about 4,500 of the people expected to fill 8,000 seasonal positions across the park service were working in seasonal roles, according to the data from the National Parks Conservation Association.

The federal government has been doing this annual survey for decades. It currently interviews over 70,000 people 12 years and older in households across the United States.Sponsor MessageShots - Health NewsThese habits can cut the risk of depression in half, a new study findsThe new report shows that the prevalence of serious suicidal thoughts in 12-to-17-year-olds fell from nearly 13% in 2021 to 10% in 2024. And the prevalence of suicide attempts by teens also fell slightly — from 3.6% to 2.7%.Suicide is complex and influenced by awhole host of risk factors, including untreated mental illness, prolonged stress, isolation and access to lethal means such as firearms and medications. The new report doesn't delve into the potential causes for the improvement in teens in recent years. But one reason might be that more teens are opening up to others about their suicidal thoughts, says Harkavy-Friedman. She pointed to a suicide prevention program run by her organization calledTalk Saves Lives, which educates people about the warning signs of suicide.""Not keeping it inside and just sharing with someone that you're struggling can be helpful,"" she says.Shots - Health NewsTo Prevent Pregnancy-Related Depression, At-Risk Women Advised To Get CounselingBesides, she adds, more teens have been seeking help and finding it.""More and more kids are getting connected with treatment.

NASA has put out a call for private groups to potentially take over the cost of maintaining the instrument, which measures carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere.NASA TV/NASAhide captiontoggle captionNASA TV/NASAThe Trump administration has asked NASA employees to draw up plans to end at least two major satellite missions, according to current and former NASA staffers. If the plans are carried out, one of the missions would be permanently terminated, because the satellite would burn up in the atmosphere.The data the two missions collect is widely used, including by scientists, oil and gas companies and farmers who need detailed information about carbon dioxide and crop health. They are the only two federal satellite missions that were designed and built specifically to monitor planet-warming greenhouse gases.Sponsor MessageIt is unclear why the Trump administration seeks to end the missions. The equipment in space is state of the art and is expected to function for many more years, according to scientists who worked on the missions. Anofficial reviewby NASA in 2023 found that ""the data are of exceptionally high quality"" and recommended continuing the mission for at least three years.Both missions, known as the Orbiting Carbon Observatories, measure carbon dioxide and plant growth around the globe. They use identical measurement devices, but one device is attached to a stand-alone satellite while the other is attached to the International Space Station. The standalone satellite would burn up in the atmosphere if NASA pursued plans to terminate the mission.NASA employees who work on the two missions are making what the agency calls Phase F plans for both carbon-monitoring missions, according to David Crisp, a longtime NASA engineer who designed the instruments and managed the missions until he retired in 2022. Phase F plans lay out options for terminating NASA missions.Crisp says NASA employees making those termination plans have reached out to him for his technical expertise. ""What I have heard is direct communications from people who were making those plans, who weren't allowed to tell me that that's what they were told to do. But they were allowed to ask me questions,"" Crisp says. ""They were asking me very sharp questions. The only thing that would have motivated those questions was [that] somebody told them to come up with a termination plan.""Sponsor MessageThree other academic scientists who use data from the missions confirmed that they, too, have been contacted with questions related to mission termination. All three asked for anonymity because they are concerned that speaking about the mission termination plans publicly could endanger the jobs of the NASA employees who contacted them.Two current NASA employees also confirmed that NASA mission leaders were told to make termination plans for projects that would lose funding underPresident Trump's proposed budgetfor the next fiscal year, or FY 2026, which begins Oct. 1. The employees asked to remain anonymous, because they were told they would be fired if they revealed the request.A rocket launches carrying the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite on July 2, 2014, at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.

Many companies also rushed to import things before tariffs kicked in and then held off from passing on the full costs of the implemented tariffs to consumers.But that's starting to change.EconomyAre prices going up because of tariffs? Here's what we knowInflation is picking up, with bothconsumer inflationanda separate inflation gaugefavored by the Fed showing prices increasing more than the previous month.The labor market is also starting to show signs of cooling. A report by the Labor Department last week showed only 73,000 jobs were added in July, fewer than the 100,000 jobs economists had anticipated.It got worse: The report said the U.S. had added a whopping 258,000 fewer jobs in the previous two months than first estimated. In response, Trump firedthe top officialwho had been in charge of gathering the data, accusing her — without evidence — of having manipulated the numbers.In addition to a cooling labor market, the economy is growing more slowly. Data last week showed the U.S. gross domestic productgrew much slowerin the first half of this year than in the previous two years.Sponsor MessageBut the full impact on the U.S. is not yet hereThe effects of tariffs are likely to get bigger.Trump has long claimed that tariffs will be paid for by countries that want to export to the country. In fact, most economists say that the tariff costs will likely be split: Some of the costs will be paid by exporters overseas, some by importers in the U.S., and some by American consumers.BusinessAutomakers are eating the cost of tariffs — for nowThe Yale Budget Lab estimated last week that the average cost of Trump's tariffs to the American householdwould be $2,400this year, with clothes and textiles likely to see the biggest effects.And contrary to Trump's repeated claims that tariffs will boost the economy, experts believe the economy will get weaker, with higher inflation and slower job growth. And the weak labor market report last week will also likely spur more discussions about whether the economy could evenenter a recession.There is one consolation: For the most part, Trump's tariffs are not as high as the ones he first unveiled in April.The Yale Budget Lab now estimates the average effective tariff rate willbe around 18.3%, compared to its initial estimate of an average ofmore than 20%after Trump's ""Liberation Day"" announcement in April — but that's still about a sixfold increase from what Americans were used to paying before Trump returned to the White House.Here's the other thing to keep in mind: Tariffs, according to the Yale Budget Lab, will still be at their highest levels since 1935.Nike is among the companies warning they will face additional costs because of tariffs.Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Imageshide captiontoggle captionJim Watson/AFP via Getty ImagesThe U.S. will raise money from tariffs — but it's still heavily in debtTrump has often touted the revenues the U.S. could raise from tariffs as another justification for imposing them.And indeed, money is coming in.

The problem is that the U.S. is still heavily in debt — and Trump's other policies, especially his massive tax cut and spending bill, which he calls the ""Big Beautiful Bill,"" willincrease that debt.The Congressional Budget Office estimates the GOP bill would increase the federal debt by $2.4 trillion.In other words, tariffs will indeed bring in money, but potentially not as much as Trump's policies that will increase the nati",unknown,2025-08-04T13:29:01.303323,economya trump tariff take shape america win august nampresid trump announc initi sweep round tariff rose garden white hous washington april andrew harnik getti imageshid captiontoggl captionandrew harnik getti imageswhen come tariff presid trump clear win politicsth white hous set swath new tariff rate new date dozen countriesa administr impos sweep tariff world presid trump argu import tax make america great rich make countri respect countri world usher golden age realiti prove differ tariff spark intens uncertainti world unclear end point explain effect tariff main street usa china sponsor messageth start feel effectsfor month full impact trump tariff clear big reason trump set tariff includ tax everyth import delay mani other mani compani rush import thing tariff kick held pass full cost implement tariff consum start chang economyar price go tariff knowinfl pick bothconsum inflationanda separ inflat gaugefavor fed show price increas previou month labor market start show sign cool labor depart last week show job ad job economist anticip got ad whop job previou month estim respons trump firedth top officialwho charg gather data accus evid manipul number addit cool labor market economi grow data last week show gross domest productgrew slowerin half year previou year sponsor messagebut full impact hereth effect tariff like get trump claim tariff paid countri want export countri fact economist tariff cost like split cost paid export oversea import american consum businessautomak eat cost tariff nowth yale budget lab estim last week averag cost trump tariff american householdwould year cloth textil see effect contrari trump repeat claim tariff boost economi expert believ economi get inflat job growth weak labor market last week like spur discuss economi evenent recess consol part trump tariff high one unveil april yale budget lab estim averag effect tariff rate willb compar initi estim averag trump liber day announc april sixfold increas american use pay trump return white hous thing keep mind tariff yale budget lab level nike compani warn face addit cost tariff jim watson afp getti imageshid captiontoggl captionjim watson afp getti imagesth rais money tariff debttrump tout revenu rais tariff justif impos money come data kept treasuri depart raisedabout billionsinc tariff took effect sponsor yale budget lab estim tariff bring period substanti amount money problem debt trump polici massiv tax cut spend bill call big beauti bill willincreas debt congression budget offic estim gop bill increas feder debt word tariff bring money much trump polici increas nati,"{""word_count"": 803, ""char_count"": 5000, ""sentence_count"": 11, ""avg_word_length"": 5.5, ""vocabulary_richness"": 0.5725, ""most_common_words"": [[""tariff"", 27], [""trump"", 15], [""cost"", 6], [""estim"", 6], [""effect"", 5], [""budget"", 5], [""getti"", 4], [""import"", 4], [""countri"", 4], [""show"", 4]]}",803,11,0.5725

It's part of anenormously popular gamethat's beena triumph for the public library that runs it.""This summer, we have 16,000 active players and more than half of them are adults,"" says library director Eli Neiburger. Not bad for a library that serves about 150,000 people. It's such a local sensation thatone couple even got marriedwhile playing what's known in town as ""The Summer Game.""The Summer Game started as a reading challenge, but that didn't work very well, Neiburger says. Kids who didn't like reading would slog through the requisite number of books to get points, then be done for the summer. Kids who read long books resented getting the same number of points as those who read short ones.Sponsor MessageSo around 2011, the library decided to pivot. ""Instead of a reading game, we started a library-using game,"" Neiburger explained. ""It includes reading, going to events, using our website, discovering all the things that the library has to offer. And it has been successful beyond our wildest dreams.""The Summer Game's design, he said, was inspired by corporate loyalty programs such as Coke Rewards. Users earn points by solving puzzles, learning about local history and exploring neighborhoods. Points can be redeemed in the library shop for T-shirts, umbrellas and other merchandise, such as a very popular stuffed plushie animal that's updated every year.

He wanted to use The Summer Game to raise awareness that the library can be used to borrow tools, art and music as well as books, and that it offers help with homework, finding jobs and provides a third space for lectures and crafting.""Parks and Rec is not just baseball, baseball, baseball,"" he said. ""Why should a library just be read, read, read?"" The Summer Game reflects an ethos of meeting patrons where they are.

The move has triggered widespread upset and legal complaints.https://p.dw.com/p/4yVGrThe zoo said it had exhausted all other options, having sought to relocate the animalsImage: Daniel Karmann/dpa/picture allianceAdvertisementNurembergZoo has confirmed that baboons killed to keep down numbers were fed to predators, amid public criticism after it was revealed the animals had been dismembered after death.News of the culling sparked complaintsfrom animal groups over zoo ethics, animal welfare, and culling practices, with the animals decapitated and some having their hands and feet removed.What did the zoo say about the baboon killings?Deputy zoo director Jörg Beckmann told the DPA news agency that the skulls and brains from the bodies were separated for scientific purposes.Six of the 12 Guinea baboons, which were culled due to overcrowding, were then fed to lions, tigers, maned wolves and marbled polecats. Hands and feet were removed ""out of respect for visitors"" who would see the carnivores feeding, Beckmann said.Skeletons of four baboons are being prepared for museum display, the zoo said. Two baboons died during sedation and were sent for pathology rather than being used as feed.Beckmann said the zoo had openlycommunicated in advance that the baboons would be used as food.""We continue to be transparent and stand by that decision,"" he said. He explained that whole-animal feeding provides crucial dental health benefits for carnivores, as bones and fur help prevent tartar buildup, unlike processed food. ""Unlike many pets, our animals don't need tartar removal under general anesthesia.""He also emphasized the behavioral benefits of such feeding practices, which mimic natural hunting conditions.""Evolution equipped them with claws and teeth for this. There's no nature documentary about big predators where they don't spectacularly hunt or feed on a carcass.""The zoo had said the baboons were killed because the enclosure was chronically overcrowded and no longer met welfare standards. Attempts to rehome the animals failed, and contraceptive measures for the females had not worked as hoped.Tons of ice keep polar bears cool in Prague ZooTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 videoIn a statement last week, the zoo said it acknowledged the emotional impact of the move, saying it understood that many people are ""confused, affected, or angry.""The zoo explained that the group had grown to more than 40 animals—far exceeding the enclosure's intended capacity of 25 adult baboons.What has been the reaction?Animal welfare groups reacted strongly. The Nuremberg-Fürth public prosecutor's office confirmed it had received hundreds of criminal complaints over the allegedly unlawful killings and is now reviewing the case.The activist group Animal Rebellion began setting up a protest camp near the zoo on Monday. The camp is expected to remain until the following Monday, with organizers demanding an immediate halt to further killings and an end to breeding programs.In a statement, the zoo said: ""Every protest that remains peaceful is acceptable to us.""Why did the zoo says the baboon cull was necessary?Nuremberg Zoo said the culling was a last resort after years of trying to control the baboon population through non-lethal means, with contraception having only a limited effect and disrupting natural group dynamics.Despite outreach to many institutions, no suitable home was found for the surplus animals.Expanding the facility again wasn’t feasible due to space and funding priorities.

allianceAdvertisementEuropean hotel owners are joining together in a class actionsuit against the online platform Booking.com, with more than 10,000 hotels have now signed on to the damages suit.According to the Association of Hotels, Restaurants and Cafes in Europe HOTREC, which represents the industry within the EU, hotel owners will seek compensation for losses incurred between 2004 and 2024 as a result of so-called ""best-price"" clauses that keep hotels from offering rooms for less on their own sites.The initiative is also backed by 30 national hotel associations, including the German Hotel Association (IHA).Netherlands-based Booking.com used the clauses as a way to prevent what it called ""free-rider"" bookings, which it defined as a customer discovering a hotel on Booking.com but then booking directly with the hotel and not the online giant.These clauses had required hotels not to offer rooms at lower prices on other platforms, including their own websites.What is the basis of the claims?A suit to be brought before an Amsterdam court by the Hotel Claims Alliance — and supported by HOTREC and 30 more hotel associations — cites a September 19, 2024European Court of Justice (ECJ)verdict finding best-price clauses illegal.The ECJ ruled that online platforms could operate without putting such restrictions on partner hotels.Booking.com did away with the clause in 2024 as a result of the European Union Digital Markets Act.""European hoteliers have long suffered from unfair conditions and excessive costs,"" according to HOTREC President Alexandros Vassilikos.""This joint initiative sends a clear message: abusive practices in the digital market will not be tolerated by the hospitality industry in Europe.""HOTREC on Monday announced an extension of the time limit to join the suit against Booking.com until August 29.""The class action is receiving overwhelming support,"" IHA Managing Director Markus Luthe told Germany's DPA news agency.What has Booking.com said?Booking.com said has not received an official lawsuit, according to reporting by DPA.""This is a statement from HOTREC, not a filed class action,"" the company said in response to an inquiry.It also rejected the claims by the hotel associations, and the legal arguments based on the ECJ ruling.""Each of our accommodation partners is free to set their own distribution and pricing

But businesses and economists say the 'mother's pension' is an extra burden on younger generations.https://p.dw.com/p/4yUYiThe five-billion-euro raise in mothers' pensions will give former stay-at-home moms 20 euros extra per monthImage: Channel Partners/Zoonar/picture allianceAdvertisementTheChristian Social Union(CSU), the Bavarian sister-party to ChancellorFriedrich Merz's conservativeChristian Democratic Union(CDU), appears to have persuaded its big sibling to implement one of its own pet projects: Raising the pension subsidy for older parents — colloquially known as theMütterrente,or ""mother's pension"" — one year earlier than planned.Thepensionrise for parents who had children before 1992 comes with a price tag of around €5 billion annually and is now set to be implemented on January 1, 2027, despite major cuts elsewhere in Germany's federal budget.According to German media reports,the government still has a gap of some €172 billion ($198 billion)for its financial planning for the years 2027 to 2029.The planned rise in 2027 is the third of three steps and adds an extra half a percentage point to the pension — that works out at around €20 per child per month for children born before 1992. Previously, parents whose children were born after 1992 received a slightly higher percentage.CSU General Secretary Martin Huber called the move the ""completion"" of the mother's pension plan, and said that 10 million women would profit. ""For many female pensioners, this rise makes a big difference,"" he told theRNDnews network.For this elderly German shopkeeper, retirement not an optionTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 videoWho does the mother's pension benefit?Though the change will iron out a disparity between the pensions received by older and younger generations, experts say the measure does nothing to close the gender pay gap between men and women, or indeed overall inequality in the country. Despite the name, all parents are eligible for the ""mother's pension,"" as are foster parents and grandparents, if the child lived with them for a significant amount of time.Peter Haan, specialist in state finance policy at the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW), and co-author of a study on the pension, thinks it's not an effective way to close the ""gender pension gap.""The key question, as far as Haan is concerned, is who actually benefits. It does, he admitted, make superficial sense for older mothers to get the same benefits as those who had their children after 1992. ""But the pensions for that generation were significantly higher than for the younger generation,"" Haan told DW. ""And secondly, it's a 'watering can' measure that is equal for all mothers, and so doesn't specifically do anything to combat poverty among older people.""The €20 per child per month might certainly be useful for many older people with lower incomes, but the very poorest women won't profit from it anyway — because the ""mother's pension"" is actually deducted from any welfare benefits they receive.Helping families — especially Bavarian onesThe mother's pension dates back to 2013, when the CSU pushed through the plan underAngela Merkel's government as a way to compensate parents — in practice mainly mothers —  who took time off to raise children and therefore paid less into the pension system.Since then, the CSU has made the plan one of its key policies, not least because it is popular among its own Bavarian electorate —many of whom are older people. In the intervening years, keeping the mother's pension has been the CSU's line in the sand in negotiations with its coalition partners the CDU and the center-leftSocial Democratic Party(SPD).""Backing down on this issue would be unthinkable for a CSU leader,"" political scientist Ursula Münch, director of the Tutzing Academy for Political Education in Bavaria, told DW. ""If the other parties do not meet it, it will refuse to support their proposals while playing on public opinion in an ageing society.""Germany's labor shortage: Lufthansa turns to retireesTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 videoHelping the old at the expense of the youngBut the idea is also unpopular among Germany's business community, who have been hoping that Merz's conservative government would, instead of increasing pensions, do more to keep more people on the job market. ""All this is going completely in the wrong direction,"" said Judith Röder of the Federal Association of Wholesale, Foreign Trade and Services (BGA). ""Everything that leads to increased welfare spending is a problem, and anything that signals less employment in an ageing society is also bad. And the mother's pension is both of those things.""""[Raising the mother'",unknown,2025-08-04T13:29:01.303323,societygermanygermani rais pension ben knight germani give parent pension thank bavarian csu busi economist mother pension extra burden gener euro rais mother pension give former stay home mom euro extra monthimag channel partner zoonar pictur allianceadvertisementthechristian social union csu bavarian sister parti chancellorfriedrich merz conservativechristian democrat union cdu appear persuad big sibl implement pet project rais pension subsidi parent known tterrent mother pension year plan thepensionris parent children come price tag set implement januari major cut germani feder budget german media govern gap financi plan year plan rise third step add extra half percentag point pension work child month children born parent children born receiv percentag csu gener secretari martin huber call move complet mother pension plan women profit mani femal pension rise make big differ therndnew network elderli german shopkeep retir view video pleas enabl javascript consid upgrad web browser thatsupport html pension benefit chang iron dispar pension receiv gener expert measur noth close gender pay gap men women overal inequ countri name parent elig pension foster parent grandpar child live signific amount time peter haan specialist state financ polici german institut econom research diw author studi pension think effect way close gender pension gap key question haan concern benefit admit make superfici sens mother get benefit children pension gener gener haan water measur equal mother anyth combat poverti peopl child month use mani peopl incom poorest women profit mother pension deduct welfar benefit receiv help famili bavarian mother pension date csu push plan underangela merkel govern way compens parent practic mother took time rais children paid pension system csu made plan key polici least popular bavarian elector mani peopl interven year keep mother pension csu line sand negoti coalit partner cdu center leftsoci democrat parti spd back issu unthink csu leader polit scientist ursula nch director tutz academi polit educ bavaria parti meet refus support propos play public opinion age societi germani labor shortag lufthansa turn retireesto view video pleas enabl javascript consid upgrad web browser thatsupport html videohelp old expens youngbut idea unpopular germani busi commun hope merz conserv govern increas pension keep peopl job market go wrong direct judith der feder associ wholesal foreign trade servic bga everyth lead increas welfar spend problem anyth signal employ age societi bad pension thing rais mother,"{""word_count"": 772, ""char_count"": 5000, ""sentence_count"": 18, ""avg_word_length"": 5.771883289124668, ""vocabulary_richness"": 0.6419098143236074, ""most_common_words"": [[""pension"", 21], [""mother"", 11], [""parent"", 7], [""csu"", 7], [""plan"", 6], [""rais"", 5], [""gener"", 5], [""children"", 5], [""germani"", 4], [""bavarian"", 4]]}",772,18,0.6419098143236074

He fled his homeland in April 2006, after the area came under heavy shelling during Sri Lanka's civil war.The conflict, which spanned from the mid 1980s to 2009, was primarily a struggle between the Sinhalese majority and the Tamil minority, with the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) — also known as theTamil Tigers— fighting government forces for an independent state.When he returned after the conflict had ended, he and 107 others found their farming land was under government control. They said attempts to farm on their land were met with threats of arrest, and a fence was later erected to stop them from gaining access.To date, they say they have not received any compensation.Now, their land has been allocated as the site for a newsolar powerplant to be built as a collaborative project between Sri Lanka's Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) andIndia'sstate-owned National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC).Indian Prime MinisterNarendra Modiand Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake jointly inaugurated the projectduring Modi's visit to Sri Lanka in April.A battle for compensationThe land belonging to Chitravelayutham and the other villagers was designated as a high-security zone in 2008, at the height of the civil war.Kandumani Lavakusarasa, the coordinator of the AHAM Humanitarian Resource Center in Trincomalee, said over 500 acres had now been allocated for the solar power plant.Of that total, he said 147 acres used to be farming land belonging to villagers including Chitravelayutham, and a further 58 acres was residential land.Modi (left) signed a raft of defense and energy deals to boost relations with Sri LankaImage: Ishara S. Kodikara/AFP/Getty ImagesThe Governor of the Eastern Province's Media Division told DW that ""legal action"" was being taken to provide redress to claimants ""who have rights to the land,"" while those ""who are able to prove their legal status in writing and live here can apply for the compensation process.""Although the villagers have temporary deeds, they said the Divisional Secretariat, which handles land allocation, had requested to see the original deeds and survey plans before examining any claims.The villagers told DW they wanted their original lands back because they were fertile and well irrigated, and that other land would likely not meet the same specifications.In a statement, the Muthur Divisional Secretariat (DS), which is responsible for oversight of the land in Sampur, told DW that only two people had applied for compensation, but did not say whether they had received it.It also said officials had received a report from 33 people requesting that the land be returned to them, but that they were ""currently residing in other government land and engaged in cultivation."" The DS added that steps would be taken to provide alternative land ""if they are confirmed to be truly landless"".Dhammike Wimalaratne, spokesperson for the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), told DW that he had no knowledge that anyone had come forward to claim the land, which had been identified as being owned by the government.However, he added that ""the people are number one"" and said they should meet the Divisional Secretariat to prove their right of ownership.DW reached out to India's NTPC and government officials for comment but did not receive a response by the time of publication.India-Sri Lanka relationsInitially, India and Sri Lanka wanted to collaborate on a coal power plant in Sampur, but the plan was scrapped in 2016 after a widespread outcry.Current president Dissanayake's Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) party was a staunch opponent of the initial plan.""People were happy because they thought they would get their land back, but it didn't happen,"" AHAM coordinator Lavakusarasa told DW.Tamils fight back against land grabs in Sri LankaTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 videoVillager Chitravelayutham said he had voted for leftist Dissanayake, whose government took power in November, in the hopes that things might change.""We thought that when this government came to power, they would give us our land back, but it doesn't look like we're going to get",unknown,2025-08-04T13:29:01.303323,politicssri lankasri lanka farmer fight solar plan ancestr landsjeevan ravindranin sampur sri lanka august tamil farmer sri lankan indian govern plan solar power plant eastern sri lanka use land seiz countri civil war done compens farmer block farm ancestr landimag jeevan ravindranadvertisementstand next tall wire fenc sinnathurai chitravelayutham look farm year allow use ask feel get upset year old chitravelayutham rice farmer sampur easternsri lanka strincomale district fled homeland april area came heavi shell sri lanka civil war conflict span mid struggl sinhales major tamil minor separatist liber tiger tamil eelam ltte known thetamil tiger fight govern forc independ state return conflict end other found farm land govern control attempt farm land met threat arrest fenc erect stop gain access date receiv compens land alloc site newsolar powerpl built collabor project sri lanka ceylon electr board ceb andindia sstate own nation thermal power corpor ntpc indian prime ministernarendra modiand sri lankan presid anura kumara dissanayak inaugur projectdur modi visit sri lanka april battl compensationth land belong chitravelayutham villag design high secur zone height civil war kandumani lavakusarasa coordin aham humanitarian resourc center trincomale acr alloc solar power plant total acr use farm land belong villag includ chitravelayutham acr residenti land modi left sign raft defens energi deal boost relat sri lankaimag ishara kodikara afp getti imagesth governor eastern provinc media divis legal action taken redress claimant right land abl prove legal statu write live appli compens process villag temporari deed division secretariat handl land alloc request see origin deed survey plan examin claim villag want origin land irrig land meet specif statement muthur division secretariat respons oversight land sampur peopl appli compens receiv offici receiv peopl request land return resid govern land engag cultiv ad step taken provid altern land confirm landless dhammik wimalaratn spokesperson ceylon electr board ceb knowledg anyon come claim land identifi own govern ad peopl number meet division secretariat prove right ownership reach india ntpc govern offici comment receiv respons time public india sri lanka india sri lanka want collabor coal power plant sampur plan scrap widespread outcri current presid dissanayak janatha vimukthi peramuna jvp parti staunch oppon initi plan peopl happi thought get land happen aham coordin lavakusarasa tamil fight land grab sri lankato view video pleas enabl javascript consid upgrad web browser thatsupport html videovillag chitravelayutham vote leftist dissanayak govern took power novemb hope thing chang thought govern came power give land look go get,"{""word_count"": 773, ""char_count"": 5000, ""sentence_count"": 10, ""avg_word_length"": 5.800498753117207, ""vocabulary_richness"": 0.6334164588528678, ""most_common_words"": [[""land"", 19], [""sri"", 11], [""lanka"", 9], [""govern"", 8], [""power"", 6], [""plan"", 5], [""farm"", 5], [""chitravelayutham"", 5], [""farmer"", 4], [""sampur"", 4]]}",773,10,0.6334164588528678

Many initiallyseek refuge in neighboring countriessuch as Iran orPakistan, however, they are often among the first people to be blamed for pushing up unemployment and crime.Arbitrarily arrested and deportedAfter the recent12-day war between Israel and Iran, Iranian authorities launched a large-scale deportation campaign against Afghans who they say are living in their country illegally.In response to the deportation campaign, more than 1,300 Iranian and Afghan activists, journalists, artists, and citizens have written an open letter to the Iranian government.They are calling for an immediate end to the repression of Afghan refugees, who are being arbitrarily arrested and deported. They also call on the Iranian people to oppose these attacks so that their silence is not perceived as complicity.Refugees have long complained about systematic and increasingly intense racist attitudes in society, which they say are being fueled by the authorities.Over a million Afghans forced back from Iran to Taliban ruleTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 videoNegative coverage in Iranian media shifts blame for social and economic problems onto refugees, fueling resentment among disadvantaged groups and turning them against the migrants.Zahra recalls that, as a documented refugee, she wasn't even given a place in school, on the grounds that there weren't enough places for locals.""The deportations in recent months have often been carried out without regard for international standards,"" argued Afghan human rights activist Abdullah Ahmadi. ""Many of those deported were taken to the border overnight — without shelter, medical care, or adequate food. Some even had to pay for the journey themselves.""Among the returnees are numerous families who returned to Afghanistan on their own initiative for fear of arbitrary arrest. Many of them say they have not received their outstanding wages or the deposits they paid for their apartments.Cooperation with the TalibanIn response to growing criticism, the Iranian authorities emphasize that they had asked all ""illegal"" refugees toleave the country six months ago.Nader Yarahmadi, head of the Center for Foreigners and Refugees at the Ministry of the Interior, told the state news agency IRNA in early July: ""We announced in March that all illegal migrants must leave the country by July 15 at the latest.""The increased number of irregular immigrants from Afghanistan following theTaliban's takeoverhas placed an enormous strain on the country's limited resources.

They hope it could provide insight into today's climate crisis.https://p.dw.com/p/4yOTsScientists at the Little Dome C camp in Antarctic, where they retrieved the ancient iceImage: PNRA_IPEVAdvertisementScientists in Germany are studying a 1.2-million-year-oldice core retrieved from Antarcticaafter years of planning and months of drilling in temperatures of -35 degrees Celsius (-31 Fahrenheit).International teams reached depths of 2,800 meters (1.74 miles) into the Antarctic ice sheet to claim the oldest continuous ice core to have ever been drilled. The scientists are now hoping it will unlock vital information about theEarth's climate.""Ice cores are climate archives, so they tell us something about the climate history of the Earth,"" said Maria Hörhold, glaciologist at theAlfred Wegener Institute (AWI),where one of the samples is being studied.The core contains air bubbles allowing scientists to measure the quantities ofgreenhouse gases, like CO2,held in the atmosphere over the last 1.2 million years.Researchers hope the ice samples will unlock more secrets about Earth's carbon cycleImage: PNRA_IPEVThey hope the ice core could help scientists better understand climate change by shedding more light on the connection between the carbon cycle and the temperatures on the planet.Improving predictions on climateIn past ice core samples, researchers were able to see alternating hot periods with cold, or glacial periods, that took place approximately every 100,000 years. But looking further back, the cold temperatures occurred more frequently — around every 40,000 years.""This is mainly driven, for example, by planetary features, like how the Earth is positioned towards the Sun,"" Hörhold told DW. ""But people do not really know why we shifted from a 40,000-year cycle at say 1.5 million years ago to what we have today.""By extending the 800,000-year-old ice core record and figuring out why the cycle changed, researchers hope to ""improve predictions of how Earth's climate may respond to future greenhouse gas increases,"" said Liz Thomas of theBritish Antarctic Survey.""There is no other place on Earth that retains such a long record of the past atmosphere as Antarctica,"" added Thomas in a statement. ""It's our best hope to understand the fundamental drivers of Earth's climate shifts.""Scientists spent months drilling to reach the ancient ice so they could extend the ice recordImage: PNRA_IPEVCO2 concentrations higher than everScientists already know that concentrations of greenhouse gases, like CO2, were lower during colder periods on Earth. Whileduring warmer times,a build-up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere prevented heat from escaping.""The idea is that you understand how the climate internally interacts, so how do atmospheric patterns interact, how does ice sheet elevation interact with sea level, and so on,"" she told DW, adding that studying the ice core would hopefully improve their understanding of those interactions.However, she added that even during previous warm periods in Earth's history, CO2 concentrations were much lower than they are today. The current high levels are primarily the result of human-driven global warming, caused by the burning of fossil fuels like oil and gas.A project across EuropeThe pan-European ice core study is part of theBeyond EPICA – Oldest Iceproject.The ice sample has been cut into one-meter length pieces.

Rivian is currently able to sell EVs directly to consumers in 25 states and in Washington, D.C.Ohio’s BMV did not immediately respond to a request for comment.“Ohio’s prohibition of Rivian’s direct-sales-only business model is irrational in the extreme: it reduces competition, decreases consumer choice, and drives up consumer costs and inconvenience — all of which harm consumers — with literally no countervailing benefit,” lawyers for the company wrote in the complaint.Rivian is asking the court to allow the company to apply for a dealership license so it can sell vehicles directly. Ohio customers have to buy from Rivian vehicles from locations in other states where direct sales are allowed. The cars are then shipped to Rivian service centers within Ohio.Allowing Rivian to sell directly would not be treading new legal ground, the company argues in its complaint. Tesla has had a license to sell in Ohio since 2013 and can sell directly to consumers.What’s stopping Rivian is a 2014 law passed by the state’s legislature. That law, which Rivian says came after an intense lobbying effort by the Ohio Automobile Dealers Association (OADA), effectively gave Tesla a carve-out and blocked any future manufacturers from acquiring the necessary dealership licenses. (The OADA did not immediately return a request for comment.)Techcrunch eventTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agendaNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Blade founder and CEO Rob Wiesenthal will continue to lead the business, which will operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Joby.Blade’s medical division, which transports organs, isn’t included in the transaction and will remain a separate company.The deal gives Joby instant access to a network of 12 terminals in key markets like New York City — notably, a dedicated lounge as well as terminal bases at John F. Kennedy International Airport, Newark Liberty Airport, the West Side of Manhattan, the East Side of Manhattan, and Wall Street.Blade, founded in 2014, doesn’t own a fleet of aircraft. Instead, the company has developed a digital network that allows passengers to book private rides on helicopters across several short-hop routes. The service has grown in popularity as well-heeled customers seek ways to avoid traffic on their commutes from the suburbs into Manhattan, or to The Hamptons for weekends and holidays. The company, which also offers access to routes from Nice, France, to Monaco and Saint-Tropez, flew more than 50,000 passengers in 2024.Joby Aviation founder and CEO JoeBen Bevirt described the deal as a “strategically important” acquisition that will support its launch of its commercial operations in Dubai and subsequent global rollout. The company said it will integrate its software, which is designed to manage air taxi operations, into Blade’s passenger service.Joby, founded in 2009 by Bevirt, has been working for more than a decade to develop, certify, and produce an electric vertical take off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft for commercial taxi service in cities. (The company is also pursuing a separatedefense-related business.) Eventually, the branded Blade service will use electric air taxis, not helicopters, in its service, according to the companies.Techcrunch eventTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agendaNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.
