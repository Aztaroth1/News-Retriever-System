The district attorney’s officehas been investigatingTrump’s alleged role in a hush money payment scheme involving adult film star Stormy Daniels that dates to the 2016 presidential election. AllCatch Up34 PostsOur live coverage ofTrump’s historic indictment has moved.Link Copied!Trump arraignment has ""unparalleled public interest,"" but it won't be broadcast, judge saysFrom CNN's Tierney SneedActing New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan wrote his Monday night order that the media’s request to broadcast the arraignment of former President Donald Trump was understandable, but that the news organizations’ interests in providing the broadest possible access to the proceedings must be weighed against “competing interests.”In rejecting the request to broadcast the arraignment live on television, Merchan still wrote about the historical significance of the proceeding in stark terms.“That this indictment involves a matter of monumental significance cannot possibly be disputed. Never in the history of the United States has a sitting or past President been indicted on criminal charges. Mr. Trump’s arraignment has generated unparalleled public interest and media attention,” he wrote. “The populace rightly hungers for the most accurate and current information available. To suggest otherwise would be disingenuous.”Link Copied!Judge will only briefly allow photos in the courtroom before Trump arraignment beginsFrom CNN's Tierney SneedNews outlets will not be allowed to broadcast formerPresident Donald Trump’s arraignmenton Tuesday in a New York state court, a judge said Monday night, but he will allow some photographers to take pictures in the courtroom before the proceedings formally begin.Acting New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchanrejected the requestby several media organizations, including CNN, for permission to broadcast the historic proceedings. Trump’s arraignment — like most arraignments in the Manhattan courthouse — is a public proceeding, but news cameras are not usually allowed to broadcast from inside the courtroom.However, the judge is allowing five pool photographers to take still photos at the beginning of the proceedings “until such time as they are directed to vacate the jury box by court personnel.”Earlier on Monday, Trump’s lawyers urged the judge to reject the media’s request for live cameras in the courtroom. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office told the judge they didn’t have a position.The media outlets that tried to get cameras into the courtroom argued that “the gravity of this proceeding … and, consequently, the need for the broadest possible public access, cannot be overstated.”Trump is now in Manhattan ahead of the arraignment.A grand jury indicted the former presidentlast week.The arraignment is also expected to bring the unsealing of the criminal charges against Trump, which have not yet been seen by his lawyers or the public.The indictment stems from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’sinvestigationinto hush-money payments, made during the 2016 presidential campaign, to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies.Trump denies all wrongdoing and his lawyers said last week that they’ll fight toget the charges dropped.Link Copied!Tuesday is the first test for Trump to navigate a legal and political strategyFrom CNN's Jeff ZelenyDonald Trump is not planning to speak publicly in New York on Tuesday, aides say, if he follows advice from members of his legal team who have urged the former President to refrain from the vitriol he’s been directing toward theprosecutorandjudgepresiding over the case.But that restraint does not extend to Florida, aides said, where he is planning to deliver a full-throated defense of his New York case as well asother investigations he is facingduring a prime time address from Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday night.It’s the first test to see whether Trump can navigate two vasty different approaches to hislegal caseand hispolitical campaign, which are now inextricably linked.“He’s taking this very seriously and following legal advice,” an adviser to Trump said Monday night. “He will make his case to Americans Tuesday night at Mar-a-Lago.”Link Copied!Trump is ""ready to go in and do what he needs to do tomorrow,"" attorney saysFrom CNN's Mary Kay MalloneeAlina Habba, lawyer for former President Donald Trump",unknown,2025-08-03T19:54:34.978202,"what we covered hereformer presidentdonald trumparrived in new york city monday, a day before he is expected to turn himself in to law enforcement andface more than 30 criminal chargesin a manhattan court following last week’s historic grand jury indictment.news outlets will not be allowedto broadcast the tuesday arraignment, a","{""word_count"": 743, ""char_count"": 5000, ""sentence_count"": 1, ""avg_word_length"": 5, ""vocabulary_richness"": 0.5, ""most_common_words"": []}",743,1,0.5

Victims of mis-sold car finance could get less than £950 per deal,"The financial services regulator will consult on a redress scheme for motorists following a court ruling, though many drivers will be ineligible.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgjy29zql25o?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=rss,"Sun, 03 Aug 2025 18:47:02 GMT",http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml,rss,"Victims of mis-sold car finance could get less than £950 per deal6 hours agoShareSaveMitchell LabiakBusiness reporter, BBC NewsShareSaveGetty ImagesVictims of car finance mis-selling will likely get less than £950 per deal under a compensation scheme proposed by the financial regulator, with the first payouts expected next year.The Supreme Court ruled on Fridaythat hidden commissions from lenders to dealers on car loans were not unlawful, meaning millions of motorists will not be able to claim.However, the judgement left open the possibility of compensation claims for particularly large commissions which the Supreme Court said were unfair.Following the ruling, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has said it will consult on running a payout scheme - estimated to cost between £9bn and £18bn.The FCA said it was ""hard to estimate precisely at this stage the total cost to industry of the scheme"", but it is understood that millions could be eligible.The industry is expected to cover the full costs of any potential compensation scheme, including any administrative costs.Those who have already complained do not need to do anything, the regulator said, advising those who have yet to complain to contact their car loan provider rather than using a claims management company.It added that it ""anticipate[s] requiring firms as far as possible to make customers aware they may be eligible and what they may need to do"" and that claims ""should cover agreements dating back to 2007"".However, the Finance & Leasing Association has said it is concerned ""about whether it is possible to have a fair redress scheme that goes back to 2007 when firms have not been required to hold such dated information"".The FCA said it will start its consultation on who should be eligible for compensation and how much they should get in October, adding that the Supreme Court ruling provided ""clarity"".On Friday, the Supreme Court reversed earlier court rulings which said that hidden commissions on car loans were unlawful.The case was brought by two specialist lenders, Close Brothers and South Africa's FirstRand, in an attempt to challenge the three consumers who collectively won a Court of Appeal case in October.However, the Supreme Court ruled that if commission is extremely high, such as in the case brought by Marcus Johnson, where the commission paid to the dealer was 55% of the total charge or credit including interest and fees - that this was a ""powerful indication"" the relationship between Mr Johnson and lender FirstRand was unfair.The Supreme Court awarded Mr Johnson the amount of a commission plus interest.The FCA said Friday's judgement ""helps us because we have been looking at what is unfair and, prior to this judgment, there were different interpretations of the law coming from different courts"".FCA chief executive Nikhil Rathi said: ""It is clear that some firms have broken the law and our rules. It's fair for their customers to be compensated.""He said consumers did not need to use a claims management company or law firm in order to make a claim, adding: ""If you do, it will cost you a significant chunk of any money you get.""Millions denied car finance payouts after Supreme Court rulingCar loan scandal payouts row - what's it about?The issue of car finance mis-selling goes back to 2021, when the FCA banned deals in which the dealer received a commission from the lender based on the interest rate charged to the customer.These were known as discretionary commission arrangements (DCAs).The FCA said DCAs provided an incentive for a buyer to be charged a higher-than-necessary interest rate, leaving them paying too much.Since January, it has been considering whether compensation should be paid to people with these deals before 2021.Some 80,000 open cases on this issue were effectively on hold until Friday's Supreme Court ruling.Following the ruling, the FCA said the compensation scheme should cover DCAs ""if they were not properly disclosed"" but also cases like Mr Johnson's, in which there was no DCA but the commission was too high.It added that the amount of money victims receive will depend on the ""degree of harm suffered by the consumer and the need to ensure consumers continue to be able to access affordable loans for motor vehicles"".The vast majority of new cars, and many second-hand ones, are bought with finance agreements, with the FCA saying it is analysing the potential market impact of any redress scheme.In February,Chancellor Rachel Reeves' attempt to intervene in the Supreme Court caseover concerns it had about the rulings potential impact on the market was blocked.The FCA said on Sunday that it expects ""a healthy finance market for new and used cars to continue notwithstanding any redress scheme we propose"".CompaniesMoneyPersonal finance",unknown,2025-08-03T19:54:34.978202,"victims of mis-sold car finance could get less than £950 per deal6 hours agosharesavemitchell labiakbusiness reporter, bbc newssharesavegetty imagesvictims of car finance mis-selling will likely get less than £950 per deal under a compensation scheme proposed by the financial regulator, with the first payouts expected next year.the supreme court ruled","{""word_count"": 766, ""char_count"": 4798, ""sentence_count"": 1, ""avg_word_length"": 5, ""vocabulary_richness"": 0.5, ""most_common_words"": []}",766,1,0.5

This includes 27 hostages who are believed to be dead.After the videos were released, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with the two hostage families, expressing ""profound shock"" and telling them that efforts to return all the hostages ""will continue constantly and relentlessly"".On Sunday, Netanyahu spoke to the head of the Red Cross in the region, requesting his immediate involvement in providing food and medical care to hostages.The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it was ""appalled"" by the videos that gave ""stark evidence of the life-threatening conditions in which the hostages are being held"".The charity reiterated its call to be granted access to the hostages to assess their condition, give them medical support and facilitate contact with their families.Hamas's armed wing Al-Qassam Brigades said it would respond positively to any Red Cross request to deliver food and medicine to prisoners if humanitarian corridors were opened into Gaza on a regular and permanent basis, and air strikes halted during the time of receiving aid.The Red Cross has faced heavy criticism in Israel over its role in the war, with claims that it has failed to help the hostages being held in Gaza.Earlier this year, amid anger over chaotic scenes as hostages were freed as part of a deal between Israel and Hamas, the organisation explained the limits of its role, saying it relies on the warring parties' goodwill to operate in conflict zones.There has also been criticism from Palestinians, as the group has not been allowed to visit Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails since 7 October 2023.At the weekend in Tel Aviv, crowds of protesters and hostage families gathered once again, calling on the Israeli government to secure the release of hostages.David and Braslavski's families said at a rally on Saturday that ""everyone must get out of hell, now.""In one video, Braslavski is seen crying as he says he has run out of food and water and only ate three ""crumbs of falafels"" that day. He says he is unable to stand or walk, and ""is at death's door"".Braslavski's family in a statement said ""they managed to break Rom"" and pleaded to Israeli and US leaders to bring their son home.""He has simply been forgotten there,"" they said.OtherA still of a video released by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad showing Rom BraslavskiIn the second video, David said ""I haven't eaten for days...

The building is ringed with CCTV cameras too.""I've never been this close,"" admits Carmen Lau.Carmen, who is 30, fled Hong Kong in 2021 as pro-democracy activists in the territory were being arrested.She argues that the UK should not allow China's ""authoritarian regime"" to have its new embassy in such a symbolic location. One of her fears is that China, with such a huge embassy, could harass political opponents and could even hold them in the building.There are also worries, among some dissidents, that its location - very near London's financial district - could be an espionage risk. Then there is the opposition from residents who say it would pose a security risk to them.The plans had previously been rejected by the local council, but the decision now lies with the government - and senior ministers have signalled they are in favour if minor adjustments are made to the plan.The site is sprawling, at 20,000 square metres, and if it goes ahead it would mark the biggest embassy in Europe. But would it also really bring the dangers that its opponents fear?The biggest embassy in EuropeChina bought the old Royal Mint Court for £255m in 2018. The area has layer upon layer of history: across the road is the Tower, parts of it were built by William the Conqueror.

British police nearby stepped over the boundary to rescue him.Back in 2019, mass protests had erupted in Hong Kong, triggered by the government's attempt to bring in a new law allowing for Hong Kong citizens to be extradited to China.China's response included a law that forced all elected officials in Hong Kong, including Carmen who was then a district councillor, to take an oath of loyalty to China. Carmen resigned instead.She claims that journalists for Chinese state-run media started following her.

Murray, a commercial model herself, said it made her feel sad and exhausted.The iconic denim company had teamed up with the AI studio Lalaland.ai to create “diverse” digital fashion models for more inclusive ads. For an industry that has failed for years to employ diverse human models, the backlash was swift, with New York Magazine calling the decision “artificial diversity.”“Modeling as a profession is already challenging enough without having to compete with now new digital standards of perfection that can be achieved with AI,” Murray told TechCrunch.Two years later, her worries have compounded. Brands continue to experiment with AI-generated models, to the consternation of many fashion lovers. The latest uproar came after Vogue’s July print edition featured a Guess ad with a typical model for the brand: thin yet voluptuous, glossy blond tresses, pouty rose lips. She exemplified North American beauty standards, but there was one problem — she was AI generated.The internet buzzed for days, in large part because the AI-generated beauty showed up in Vogue, the fashion bible that dictates what is and is not acceptable in the industry. The AI-generated model was featured in an advertisement,nota Vogue editorial spread. And Vogue told TechCrunch the ad met its advertising standards.To many, an ad versus an editorial is a distinction without a difference.TechCrunch spoke to fashion models, experts, and technologists to get a sense of where the industry is headed now that Vogue seems to have put a stamp of approval on technology that’s poised to dramatically change the fashion industry.Techcrunch eventTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agendaNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

And in the world of fashion, what happens to the humans — the models, photographers, stylists, and set designers — performing those jobs?“It’s just so much cheaper”Sinead Bovell, a model and founder of theWAYEorganization whowrote about CGI models for Voguefive years ago, told TechCrunch that “e-commerce models” are most under threat of automation.E-commerce models are the ones who pose for advertisements or display clothes and accessories for online shoppers. Compared to high-fashion models, whose striking, often unattainable looks are featured in editorial spreads and on runways, they’re more realistic and relatable.“E-commerce is where most models make their bread and butter,” Bovell said. “It’s not necessarily the path to model fame or model prestige, but it is the path for financial security.”sinead bovell, founder & modelImage Credits:Sinead BovellThat fact is running in direct contrast to the pressure many brands feel to automate such shoots. Paul Mouginot, an art technologist who has worked with luxury brands, said it’s simply expensive to work with live models, especially when it comes to photographing them in countless garments, shoes, and accessories.“AI now lets you start with a flat-lay product shoot, place it on a photorealistic virtual model, and even position that model in a coherent setting, producing images that look like genuine fashion editorials,” he told TechCrunch.Brands, in some ways, have been doing this for a while, he said. Mouginot, who is French, cited the French retailer Veepee as an example of a company that has used virtual mannequins to sell clothes since at least 2013. Other notable brands likeH&M,Mango, and Calvin Klein have also resorted to AI models.Amy Odell,a fashion writerand author of a recently publishedbiography onGwyneth Paltrow, put it more simply: “It’s just so much cheaper for [brands] to use AI models now. Brands need a lot of content, and it just adds up. So if they can save money on their print ad or their TikTok feed, they will.”PJ Pereira, co-founder of AI ad firmSilverside AI, said it really comes down to scale.

But access to that capital is harder than ever,” she said.Gao, who spoke at TechCrunch’s All Stage conference in July, said it’s possible for startup founders, especially those in later Series C stage, to navigate this particular economic environment. And they need to start with a reality check.To begin, she said, it’s important to note that only one in five startups that raise a Series A ever make it to raise a Series C. And, in the past year, the bar for raising late-stage capital has only risen; investors are no longer just chasing momentum, as many were in the last few years — they are chasingcertainty, Gao said.“Investors are now asking: ‘Is this company truly a winner in whatever market that they’re serving?’” Gao said. “The question really isn’t, ‘is this company growing?’ The question has shifted to, ‘is this company on a trajectory where the upside is really undeniable?’”Companies raising Series C rounds should meet certain criteria. For one, they’re all category leaders, according to Gao.“They’re defining their categories. They have clear go-to-market and undeniable pull,” she said. “In short, they’re growing efficiently, but there’s also traction to show that these are truly the market leaders in the spaces that they operate in.”Companies looking to raise a Series C should also remember that metrics do not always equal money. Sure, metrics are important, as are annual returns, growth, and retention, she said, but if investors are not sold on the idea that a company can truly become a leader in their respective space, then they are going to move on.Techcrunch eventTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agendaNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

For example, there are companies that don’t have amazing metrics yet somehow raise a suitable Series C round. In one case, a startup nabbed more than a $2 billion valuation, she noted. “They were effectively able to communicate the story to investors why this company will be a leading company over time,” Gao said of the company’s successful raise.Another Gao rule: continuity is better than short-term virility.In the age of AI, companies are growing faster than investors have ever seen before, she noted. “But oftentimes it’s the case, what goes up also sharply comes down,”Gao said. “So the question is, ‘is this growth sustainable?’”In a Series C, investors are looking for “compounding loops,” or seeing that the company gets stronger as it scales, she said.“Does your product get better for every new customer you sign? Does your CAC [customer acquisition cost] decrease or increase for every new user you bring on board?,” she asked.If the answer is yes, then investors will “lean in,” Gao said; if the answer is “no,” then investors are most likely to “lean out,” even if a company’s metrics look very strong.Finally, she said, founders should treat fundraising like a go-to-market campaign and seek to develop relationships with VCs before pitching them for capital. Gao cited her firm as an example. Sapphire likes to invest in a company at the Series B level, but they usually have known the company for a year or longer.“That means at the Series A, even though we’re not actively leaning in to try and raise, we’re trying to build a relationship with a company and with the founder,” she said. “We’re getting information and we’re developing a longitudinal picture of how this company has progressed.”She said founders should start building a “lightweight investor CRM,” or a database managing the relationships with investors.Investors take notes while meeting with founders, and founders should do the same, she said.
