Trump pleads not guilty to 34 felony counts,,https://edition.cnn.com/webview/politics/live-news/trump-indictment-stormy-daniels-news-04-03-23/index.html,,http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition.rss,rss,"What we covered hereFormer PresidentDonald Trumparrived in New York City Monday, a day before he is expected to turn himself in to law enforcement andface more than 30 criminal chargesin a Manhattan court following last week’s historic grand jury indictment.News outlets will not be allowedto broadcast the Tuesday arraignment, a judge ruled Monday night.Trump’s legal team said the former president will voluntarily surrender and will look tochallenge “every potential issue”once the indictment is unsealed.Trump, who has vowed to continue his 2024 bid, is the first current or former president in US history who has faced criminal charges. The district attorney’s officehas been investigatingTrump’s alleged role in a hush money payment scheme involving adult film star Stormy Daniels that dates to the 2016 presidential election. AllCatch Up34 PostsOur live coverage ofTrump’s historic indictment has moved.Link Copied!Trump arraignment has ""unparalleled public interest,"" but it won't be broadcast, judge saysFrom CNN's Tierney SneedActing New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan wrote his Monday night order that the media’s request to broadcast the arraignment of former President Donald Trump was understandable, but that the news organizations’ interests in providing the broadest possible access to the proceedings must be weighed against “competing interests.”In rejecting the request to broadcast the arraignment live on television, Merchan still wrote about the historical significance of the proceeding in stark terms.“That this indictment involves a matter of monumental significance cannot possibly be disputed. Never in the history of the United States has a sitting or past President been indicted on criminal charges. Mr. Trump’s arraignment has generated unparalleled public interest and media attention,” he wrote. “The populace rightly hungers for the most accurate and current information available. To suggest otherwise would be disingenuous.”Link Copied!Judge will only briefly allow photos in the courtroom before Trump arraignment beginsFrom CNN's Tierney SneedNews outlets will not be allowed to broadcast formerPresident Donald Trump’s arraignmenton Tuesday in a New York state court, a judge said Monday night, but he will allow some photographers to take pictures in the courtroom before the proceedings formally begin.Acting New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchanrejected the requestby several media organizations, including CNN, for permission to broadcast the historic proceedings. Trump’s arraignment — like most arraignments in the Manhattan courthouse — is a public proceeding, but news cameras are not usually allowed to broadcast from inside the courtroom.However, the judge is allowing five pool photographers to take still photos at the beginning of the proceedings “until such time as they are directed to vacate the jury box by court personnel.”Earlier on Monday, Trump’s lawyers urged the judge to reject the media’s request for live cameras in the courtroom. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office told the judge they didn’t have a position.The media outlets that tried to get cameras into the courtroom argued that “the gravity of this proceeding … and, consequently, the need for the broadest possible public access, cannot be overstated.”Trump is now in Manhattan ahead of the arraignment.A grand jury indicted the former presidentlast week.The arraignment is also expected to bring the unsealing of the criminal charges against Trump, which have not yet been seen by his lawyers or the public.The indictment stems from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’sinvestigationinto hush-money payments, made during the 2016 presidential campaign, to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies.Trump denies all wrongdoing and his lawyers said last week that they’ll fight toget the charges dropped.Link Copied!Tuesday is the first test for Trump to navigate a legal and political strategyFrom CNN's Jeff ZelenyDonald Trump is not planning to speak publicly in New York on Tuesday, aides say, if he follows advice from members of his legal team who have urged the former President to refrain from the vitriol he’s been directing toward theprosecutorandjudgepresiding over the case.But that restraint does not extend to Florida, aides said, where he is planning to deliver a full-throated defense of his New York case as well asother investigations he is facingduring a prime time address from Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday night.It’s the first test to see whether Trump can navigate two vasty different approaches to hislegal caseand hispolitical campaign, which are now inextricably linked.“He’s taking this very seriously and following legal advice,” an adviser to Trump said Monday night. “He will make his case to Americans Tuesday night at Mar-a-Lago.”Link Copied!Trump is ""ready to go in and do what he needs to do tomorrow,"" attorney saysFrom CNN's Mary Kay MalloneeAlina Habba, lawyer for

He was being starved to the point where he can be dead at any moment, and he suffers a great deal. He barely can't speak, he barely can move,"" David's brother Ilay said in an interview on Monday.In the video, Evyatar says: ""I haven't eaten for days... I barely got drinking water."" He is seen digging what he says will be his own grave.OtherA still showing Israeli hostage Evyatar David being held in a Gaza tunnel from the video released by HamasHostages' families have urged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to prioritise their release as reports suggest he might be planning to expand the military campaign.The footage of Evyatar was released after Palestinian Islamic Jihad published video of another hostage, Rom Braslavski, thin and crying.Both men were abducted from the Nova music festival during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023.They are among 50 hostages still being held in Gaza, 20 of whom are believed to be alive.Ilay David said his father had barely recognised his son Evyatar's voice on the video and had not been able to sleep. He said his mother cried all day.""Seeing those images of my brother as a human skeleton, we understood it's, it's, it's a new kind of cruelty,"" Mr David said. ""It's the lowest you can get.""He called on world leaders to unite to save him and other hostages ""from the cruel, twisted hands of Hamas"".""So we have to be so focused on delivering the message, which is, Evyatar is dying, we need to give him medicine, to give him food, proper food, and you need to get this treatment now, or else will die.""Hamas's armed wing has denied it intentionally starves prisoners, saying hostages eat what their fighters and people in Gaza eat.Ilay DavidEvyatar David (L) with his brother Ilay shown here in happier timesHundreds of Israeli ex-officials appeal to Trump to help end Gaza warWorld leaders condemn videos of emaciated Israeli hostages in Gaza as Red Cross calls for accessFamine 'currently playing out' in Gaza, UN-backed experts warnAfter the hostages' videos were released, Netanyahu spoke with their families, telling them that efforts to return all the hostages ""will continue constantly and relentlessly"".But an Israeli official - widely quoted by local media - said Netanyahu was working to free the hostages through ""the military defeat of Hamas"".The possibility of a new escalation in Gaza may further anger Israel's allies who have been pushing for an immediate ceasefire as reports of Palestinians dying from starvation or malnutrition cause shock around the world.The main group supporting hostages' families condemned the idea of a new military offensive saying: ""Netanyahu is leading Israel and the hostages to doom.""That view was pointedly made in a letter by some 600 retired Israeli security officials sent to US President Donald Trump urging him to pressure Israel to immediately end the war in Gaza.""Your credibility with the vast majority of Israelis augments your ability to steer Prime Minister [Benjamin] Netanyahu and his government in the right direction: End the war, return the hostages, stop the suffering,"" they wrote.The group included former Mossad chief Tamir Pardo, Ami Ayalon, former chief of Shin Bet - Israel's domestic secret service agency - former Prime Minister Ehud Barak, and former Defence Minister Moshe Yaalon among others.""It is our professional judgement that Hamas no longer poses a strategic threat to Israel,"" they said.""At first this war was a just war, a defensive war, but when we achieved all military objectives, this war ceased to be a just war,"" said Ayalon.The former top leaders head the Commanders for Israel's Security (CIS) group, which has urged the government in the past to focus on securing the return of the hostages.""Stop the Gaza War!

Returns could begin to take place within weeks.UK and international law prevents the government from sending asylum seekers back to their country of origin before their claim has been considered and turned down. However, they can be sent to safe countries prepared to consider their claim.How many people cross the Channel in small boats?'One in, one out' sounds simple - but the migrant deal could be complicatedExtra 300 officers to tackle small boat people smugglingThe government has not confirmed how many migrants would be returned and accepted under the plan, but said it would look to ""ramp up both the pace and scale of returns over the course of the pilot scheme"".There have been reports that 50 people per week could be returned, compared to the weekly average of more than 800 people currently making the crossing.Sir Keir has previously said the pilot is not ""a silver bullet"" but believes it will deter people from making the dangerous journey following a big increase in the numbers so far this year.As of 30 July, more than 25,000 people had crossed the Channel in small boats in 2025 - around 49% higher than at the same point in 2024.The government is under pressure to reduce the numbers, having previously promised to ""smash the gangs"" organising the journeys.Home Secretary Yvette Cooper hailed the agreement as ""ground breaking"" and an ""important step towards undermining the business model of the organised crime gangs"".""It is also right to make clear that – while the UK will always be ready to play its part alongside other countries in helping those fleeing persecution and conflict – this must be done in a controlled and managed legal way, not through dangerous, illegal, and uncontrolled routes,"" she said.On Monday, the government announced £100m to fund 300 National Crime Agency Officers to stop the people smugglers arranging the crossings.It has also said it wants to tackle illegal working, to reduce pull factors encouraging people to come to the UK.Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp said the government's deal with the French would be less effective than the Rwanda plan, proposed by the previous Conservative government.""The Rwanda removals deterrent, under which 100% of illegal arrivals would be removed, was ready to go last summer but Labour cancelled it just days before it was due to start with no proper replacement plan,"" he said.""As a result, this year so far has been the worst ever for illegal immigrants crossing the Channel.""When the UK and France first announced the plan in July, the charity Asylum Matters criticised the measure, arguing: ""The only way to stop people from making dangerous journeys is to give them real safe routes to seek sanctuary.""Migration",unknown,2025-08-04T18:05:16.146608,french small boat pilot plan come forc hour agosharesavesharesaveepath french pilot scheme aim reduc number small boat cross channel come forc detent illeg migrant due day deal see arriv small boat detain return franc exchang accept franc equal number asylum seeker provid tri make cross pass secur elig check prime minist sir starmer plan product month grown diplomaci deliv real result conserv make differ sir french presid emmanuel macron announc agreement juli subject legal scrutini european commiss member state govern commiss germani member state given green light innov approach mean scheme plan adult migrant tri get cross channel return franc claim asylum deem inadmiss return begin take place week intern law prevent govern send asylum seeker countri origin claim consid turn sent safe countri prepar claim mani peopl cross channel small boat sound simpl migrant deal complicatedextra offic tackl small boat peopl smugglingth govern confirm mani migrant return accept plan look ramp pace scale return cours pilot scheme peopl week return compar weekli averag peopl make cross sir keir pilot silver bullet believ deter peopl make danger journey follow big increas number year peopl cross channel small boat point govern pressur reduc number promis smash gang organis journey home secretari yvett cooper hail agreement ground break import step toward undermin busi model organis crime gang make clear readi play part countri help flee persecut conflict done control manag legal way danger illeg uncontrol rout monday govern announc nation crime agenc offic stop peopl smuggler arrang cross want tackl illeg work reduc pull factor encourag peopl come conserv shadow home secretari chri philp govern deal french less effect rwanda plan propos previou conserv govern rwanda remov deterr illeg arriv remov readi last summer labour cancel day due start proper replac plan result year worst illeg immigr cross channel franc announc plan chariti asylum matter criticis measur argu way stop peopl make danger journey give real safe rout seek sanctuari migrat,"{""word_count"": 650, ""char_count"": 3990, ""sentence_count"": 9, ""avg_word_length"": 5.4576802507836994, ""vocabulary_richness"": 0.6050156739811913, ""most_common_words"": [[""peopl"", 9], [""cross"", 8], [""plan"", 7], [""govern"", 7], [""small"", 6], [""boat"", 6], [""return"", 6], [""make"", 6], [""channel"", 5], [""illeg"", 5]]}",650,9,0.6050156739811913

There are currently smoke advisories across the Midwest and Northeast as a result of wildfires in Canada.Liao Pan/China News Service/VCG via Getty Imageshide captiontoggle captionLiao Pan/China News Service/VCG via Getty ImagesThis story is updated to reflect the current wildfire smoke conditions in the U.S. The original story was publishedJan. 8, 2025.Smoke from Canadian wildfires continued to prompt air quality alerts Monday in the Northeast U.S. as well as the Upper Midwest.Michigan saw astatewide air quality advisoryon Monday, and while Minnesota is seeing some relief, the wildfire smoke ispersisting in Wisconsin, andspreading across New York,Vermont, andMaine.Canada is experiencing its second worst wildfire season on record, according to government data. There have been nearly 4,000 fires recorded already this calendar year.Sponsor MessageExposure to wildfire smoke is a growing health problem across the country, as human-caused climate change increases the risk and intensity of wildfires and the smoke that can drift thousands of miles downwind from them.Here's what you need to know about the health risks — and how to protect yourself.The health risks of breathing wildfire smokeMay-Lin Wilgus, a pulmonologist and professor at UCLA, compares breathing wildfire smoke to smoking cigarettes – a lot of cigarettes.Scientists track air quality with theair quality index, or AQI, which incorporates different pollution sources like ozone and fine particulates. Many scientists don't think there's a ""safe"" AQI level becausethe measurement doesn't capture many harmful pollutants, but under 50 is often considered acceptable. Higher numbers indicate more health-damaging pollution in the air.OnMonday the AQI in Detroit was at least 159. On a smoky day, when AQI levels reach 100 to 200, ""the exposure to the fine particulate matter, the air pollution, is similar to smoking aquarter to half a pack a day,"" Wilgus says.That exposure takes a toll on a healthy person. But it is particularly harmful for those with pre-existing health issues, Wilgus adds. Emergency room visits for respiratory issues like asthma and COPDincrease dramaticallyduring wildfire smoke events, as much asdoubling in somecases. During the Canadian wildfires in 2023, when smoke wafted across much of the U.S., emergency room visits for asthmaincreased by nearly 20%.Sponsor MessageSmoke exposure can alsoworsen other medical conditions. Emergency departments see morecardiovascularrelated visits after smoky days. And a growing body of research suggests smoke exposure is linked to long-term impacts such as a higher risk ofdeveloping dementia.Overall, air quality has improved in the U.S. over the past 20 years, says Tarik Benmarhnia, a climate and health scientist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego. But wildfire smoke iserasing many of those gains.""Just maybe like ten years ago wildfire was an exceptional issue. It was something that happens once in a lifetime for most people,"" he says.But climate change has increased the chance of wildfires across many parts of the country, and the intensity of many of the burns themselves and the smoke they produce.""This is unfortunately not the first one and not the last one the people in Los Angeles are going to be experiencing,"" Benmarhnia says.Wondering what AQI is safe and what activities are safe at different AQIs? Life Kitexplains.The dangers of breathing wildfire smokeWildfires burn at extremely high temperatures, which makes their ash more toxic than other pollution, such as car exhaust. But in many cases, including during these ongoing fires,it's not just trees and organic matter that burn. Homes, cars and other materials go up in flames, too, adding potentially harmful particles to the pollution load.""It's just a toxic soup,"" says Lisa Miller, a wildfire smoke expert at the University of California, Davis. ""Think of all the synthetic fibers that are present in your living room – in your couch, in your carpet, in your clothes. All those things can be particularly toxic"" if they go up in smoke, she says.Higher risks for some peopleWildfire smoke is hazardous for everyone, but it's especially dangerous for some people, including children and older adults, pregnant people and anyone with preexisting health problems.Sponsor MessageFirst responders and firefighters are exposed to the worst of the smoke. A 2019 study found that heavy, repeated smoke exposure among wildland firefighters is linked withhigher risks of lung cancer and cardiovascular disease.Children can beespecially vulnerable, doctors say, because they breathe in more air – and therefore more smoke – relative to their body size.Pregnant people should also take care, says Miller.

They undermine the very foundation of democracy: press freedom as a check on power,"" the petition reads.Some journalists have been allowed to enter Gaza with the Israeli military, butmost reporting from the enclave is being done by Palestinian journalistsliving there.Last month, the Associated Press, AFP, BBC News and Reuters published a joint statement that their journalists in Gaza were facing ""dire circumstances"" and were ""increasingly unable to feed themselves and their families.""Since the war began after the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terror attack on Israel, 186 journalists have been killed in Gaza and 90 have been imprisoned, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.On Friday, dozens of members of the International News Safety Institute, a nonprofit group, issued a

The X ownerannouncedover the weekend that the company discovered the video archive for the popular short-form video app, thought to have been deleted, and is working to restore user access.Vine — something of a precursor to today’s TikTok, but with only six-second-long looping videos — wasacquired by Twitter back in October 2012for $30 million to expand the social media platform’s video ambitions. Unfortunately for Vine creators and fans, the company fumbled the app’s potential and decided toshut down Vine in 2016by limiting all new uploads. The following year, it was fully discontinued, though auser archiveremained for a time.Despite no longer having an App Store presence, Vine still has a place in the internet’s collective cultural consciousness. Through online compilations of the best Vines uploaded to YouTube, and through the careers of numerous creators who got their start on Vine, the company lives on to some extent, and its content continues to be discovered by new generations.Musk himself seemed interested in bringing back Vine afteracquiring Twitter in October 2022. Ina poll postedon the social media app, he asked Twitter’s users, “Bring back Vine?” to which nearly 70% responded “yes.”Axios reported at the timethat Twitter had devoted some engineers to working on the Vine reboot, but nothing ever came of it.Grok Imagine is AI Vine!Btw, we recently found the Vine video archive (thought it had been deleted) and are working on restoring user access, so you can post them if you want.— Elon Musk (@elonmusk)August 2, 2025It’s unclear whether Musk has any ambitions for Vine beyond getting its archive back online, however. In the same post about restoring Vine, he also touted that Grok’s new video-creation feature, Grok Imagine, also available to X Premium+ subscribers, is “AI Vine.” That suggests that his interests in video creation no longer lie with human creativity, but in human-directed AI prompting.Whether or not Musk will actually deliver on the promise remains to be seen, as the X post could have just been another way to draw attention to Grok AI, rather than being representative of a real effort inside the company to make old Vines available for reposting.Techcrunch eventTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agendaNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

What’s changing is that the company is separating the teams that oversee Wondery’s narrative podcast efforts from those developing its creator-led shows.Wondery is combining its narrative podcast studio, which includes podcasts like Dr. Death and American Scandal, with Audible.“The podcast landscape has evolved significantly in the past few years, particularly with the rise of video-forward, creator-led content,” Amazon said in an emailed statement.“These changes reflect that evolution and will streamline how Wondery integrates further into Amazon. By making these changes, we can better support creators in monetizing their content across multiple channels, help them expand their brand IP, and simplify the process for advertisers while making content more accessible to audiences wherever they prefer to consume it. This evolution builds on Wondery’s early success with video-forward shows and positions us to better serve creators, customers, and advertisers.”Despite securing big names in the business, the company is now shifting its strategy in an effort to better compete with rivals like Spotify and YouTube as the podcasting industry embraces video formats.Update: The article was updated to reflect that Amazon denied reports of Wondery shutting down.Techcrunch eventTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agendaNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.
