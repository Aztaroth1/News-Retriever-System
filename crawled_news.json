    "full_content": "What we covered hereFormer PresidentDonald Trumparrived in New York City Monday, a day before he is expected to turn himself in to law enforcement andface more than 30 criminal chargesin a Manhattan court following last week’s historic grand jury indictment.News outlets will not be allowedto broadcast the Tuesday arraignment, a judge ruled Monday night.Trump’s legal team said the former president will voluntarily surrender and will look tochallenge “every potential issue”once the indictment is unsealed.Trump, who has vowed to continue his 2024 bid, is the first current or former president in US history who has faced criminal charges. The district attorney’s officehas been investigatingTrump’s alleged role in a hush money payment scheme involving adult film star Stormy Daniels that dates to the 2016 presidential election. AllCatch Up34 PostsOur live coverage ofTrump’s historic indictment has moved.Link Copied!Trump arraignment has \"unparalleled public interest,\" but it won't be broadcast, judge saysFrom CNN's Tierney SneedActing New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan wrote his Monday night order that the media’s request to broadcast the arraignment of former President Donald Trump was understandable, but that the news organizations’ interests in providing the broadest possible access to the proceedings must be weighed against “competing interests.”In rejecting the request to broadcast the arraignment live on television, Merchan still wrote about the historical significance of the proceeding in stark terms.“That this indictment involves a matter of monumental significance cannot possibly be disputed. Never in the history of the United States has a sitting or past President been indicted on criminal charges. Mr. Trump’s arraignment has generated unparalleled public interest and media attention,” he wrote. “The populace rightly hungers for the most accurate and current information available. To suggest otherwise would be disingenuous.”Link Copied!Judge will only briefly allow photos in the courtroom before Trump arraignment beginsFrom CNN's Tierney SneedNews outlets will not be allowed to broadcast formerPresident Donald Trump’s arraignmenton Tuesday in a New York state court, a judge said Monday night, but he will allow some photographers to take pictures in the courtroom before the proceedings formally begin.Acting New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchanrejected the requestby several media organizations, including CNN, for permission to broadcast the historic proceedings. Trump’s arraignment — like most arraignments in the Manhattan courthouse — is a public proceeding, but news cameras are not usually allowed to broadcast from inside the courtroom.However, the judge is allowing five pool photographers to take still photos at the beginning of the proceedings “until such time as they are directed to vacate the jury box by court personnel.”Earlier on Monday, Trump’s lawyers urged the judge to reject the media’s request for live cameras in the courtroom. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office told the judge they didn’t have a position.The media outlets that tried to get cameras into the courtroom argued that “the gravity of this proceeding … and, consequently, the need for the broadest possible public access, cannot be overstated.”Trump is now in Manhattan ahead of the arraignment.A grand jury indicted the former presidentlast week.The arraignment is also expected to bring the unsealing of the criminal charges against Trump, which have not yet been seen by his lawyers or the public.The indictment stems from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’sinvestigationinto hush-money payments, made during the 2016 presidential campaign, to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies.Trump denies all wrongdoing and his lawyers said last week that they’ll fight toget the charges dropped.Link Copied!Tuesday is the first test for Trump to navigate a legal and political strategyFrom CNN's Jeff ZelenyDonald Trump is not planning to speak publicly in New York on Tuesday, aides say, if he follows advice from members of his legal team who have urged the former President to refrain from the vitriol he’s been directing toward theprosecutorandjudgepresiding over the case.But that restraint does not extend to Florida, aides said, where he is planning to deliver a full-throated defense of his New York case as well asother investigations he is facingduring a prime time address from Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday night.It’s the first test to see whether Trump can navigate two vasty different approaches to hislegal caseand hispolitical campaign, which are now inextricably linked.“He’s taking this very seriously and following legal advice,” an adviser to Trump said Monday night. “He will make his case to Americans Tuesday night at Mar-a-Lago.”Link Copied!Trump is \"ready to go in and do what he needs to do tomorrow,\" attorney saysFrom CNN's Mary Kay MalloneeAlina Habba, lawyer for former President Donald Trump"

We expect that they will behave professionally. But we also expect that they will use their seat to spread disinformation and to promote their own agenda as it relates to Ukraine, and we will stand ready to call them out at every single moment that they attempt to do that,” Greenfield added.Greenfield said she is not surprised if the Russians asked the foreign minister to come to UNSC headquarters in New York but also said council does work beyond Ukraine.“We haven’t decided yet on what our attendance levels will be, but we intend to carry out the business of the Security Council during this month. The Security Council does more than Ukraine.

    "full_content": "US sailors recover a suspected Chinese high-altitude surveillance balloon that was downed by the United States over US territorial waters off the coast of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, on February 5, 2023.U.S. Fleet Forces/U.S. Navy/ReutersWashingtonCNN—TheChinese spy balloonthat transited the US earlier this year was able to capture imagery and collect some signals intelligence from US military sites, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN.The balloon was able to transmit information back to Beijing in real time, the source said, and the US government still does not know for sure whether the Chinese government could wipe the balloon’s data as it received it. That raises questions about whether there is intelligence the balloon was able to gather that the US still doesn’t know about.Still, the intelligence community has not been overly concerned about the information the balloon was able to gather, the person said, because it is not much more sophisticated than what Chinese satellites are able to glean as they orbit over similar locations.A US intelligence official told CNN on Monday that “although analysis of the wreckage of the High Altitude Balloon remains ongoing, thus far, its flight over the United States does not appear to have provided critical new insights to the People’s Republic of China.”The US also knew what the balloon’s path would be and was able to protect sensitive sites and censor some signals before the balloon was able to pick them up,officials have said.As CNN has reported, the US intelligence community last yeardeveloped a method of trackingwhat it says is a fleet of these Chinese balloons operating across the globe, controlled by the Chinese military.The FBI is still examining the balloon, but so far officials have been able to glean additional information about how the device worked, including the algorithms used for the balloon’s software and how it is powered and designed.CNN has reached out to the National Security Council at the White House and the Pentagon for comment. NBC wasfirst to reporton the new intelligence.Video Ad FeedbackJustin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats01:33- Source:CNNJustin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats01:33The balloon first crossed into US airspace over Alaska in late January before passing through Canada and down into Montana, where it hovered for a few days, leading the US to believe it was trying to surveil sensitive military sites, like Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. It waseventually shot downby the US off the East Coast on February 4, and the incident further escalated tensions between Washington and Beijing, including the postponement of a diplomatic visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China.A senior State Department official said in February that, as the balloon floated across the US, it “was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations.”Gen. Glen VanHerck, the commander of US Northern Command and NORAD, said at the time that the US “did not assess” that the balloon “presented a significant collection hazard beyond what already exists in actionable technical means from the Chinese.”The surveillance program, which includes a number of similar balloons, is in part run out of the small Chinese province of Hainan, officials told CNN. The US does not know the precise size of the fleet of Chinese surveillance balloons, but sources tell CNN that the program has conducted at least two dozen missions over at least five continents in recent years.Roughly half a dozen of those flights have been within US airspace, although not necessarily over US territory, according to one official familiar with the intelligence.China has maintained that the balloon was actually just a weather balloon thrown off course, and the US has been assessing the possibility that it was not deliberately maneuvered into the continental US by the Chinese government, CNN hasreported.Still, China did maintain some ability to maneuver the balloon, officials believe. And once the balloon was over Montana, China appeared to take advantage of its position to loiter over sensitive sites and try to collect intelligence.This story has been updated with additional reporting.CNN’s Alex Marquardt contributed to this report."

    "full_content": "Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen waves as she arrives at a hotel in New York during a stopover on Thursday, March 30, 2023 a day before flying to Central America.John Minchillo/APHong KongCNN—Ananticipated meetingbetween Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen and US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in California this week has sparked concerns of a repeat of the pressure campaignChinalaunched last year when then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taipei.At that time, Beijingencircled the island democracywith unprecedented military drills – firing multiple missiles into its surrounding waters and sending dozens of warplanes speeding across a sensitive median line dividing the Taiwan Strait.It alsocut off contactwith the United States over a number of issues from military matters to combating climate change, in retaliation for what it viewed as a violation of its sovereignty.This time, Beijing has already threatened to “resolutely fight back” if a Tsai-McCarthy meeting goes ahead.Video Ad FeedbackSee why tensions are rising between US and China over Taiwan02:32- Source:CNNSee why tensions are rising between US and China over Taiwan02:32It also slammed Washington for allowing Tsai to stopover in the US while en route to and from official visits in Central America, warning it could lead to“serious” confrontationbetween the two powers.Adefiant Tsaistaked out her own ground, pledging as she took off on her 10-day trip not to let “external pressure” stop Taiwan from connecting with the world and like-minded democracies.But the optics of the meeting, taking place in California and not Taiwan, and its timing – at a particularly thorny moment in China’s foreign relations andahead of a presidential election in Taiwan that could reset the tone of its relationship with Beijing – may see Beijing tread more carefully this time, or at least not escalate further, analysts say.“This puts the burden on China not to overreact, because any overreaction is only going to push China further away from the world,” said Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Stimson Center think tank in Washington.That doesn’t mean, however, that Beijing won’t be closely watching Tsai’s movements as it calibrates its response – and decides how much military might to flex over her meeting with an American lawmaker on American soil.The opacity of China’s system – and the potential for competing interests within its vast bureaucracy – also make it difficult to accurately predict its response.“Every time Taiwan does anything that China doesn’t like, the Chinese react with their own military coercion,” Sun said.

Taiwan’s official Central News Agency also reported Monday that Tsai would meet with McCarthy, citing Tsai’s presidential office.Video Ad FeedbackSee image of a Chinese balloon hovering over Taiwan03:05- Source:CNNSee image of a Chinese balloon hovering over Taiwan03:05But a meeting between Tsai and the leader of the Republican majority in the US House of Representatives, who ranks second in line to the Presidency, would mark another symbolic moment for Taiwan and the US, which only maintain unofficial ties.For Tsai, who is entering the final year of her two-term presidency, “it’s clearly a capstone event,” according to Wen-Ti Sung, a political scientist at the Australian National University’s Taiwan Studies Program. “She has this image as the Taiwanese president who has taken US-Taiwan relations to new heights, and who … has been able to give Taiwan almost unprecedented international visibility,” he said.That increased visibility – and enhanced cooperation with the US – has followed China’s mounting pressure on the island, which sits fewer than 110 miles (177 kilometers) from the mainland coast.China’s Communist Party claims the self-governing island democracy as its own despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to take the island, by force if necessary.The flags of Taiwan and Honduras flutter in the wind outside the Taiwan Embassy in Tegucigalpa, Honduras March 15, 2023.

Schiappa, who is the current Minister for the Social Economy and French Associations, was photographed for the cover wearing a white dress.Schiappa has been a long-time advocate for women’s rights and was appointed as the country’s first ever Gender Equality Minister in 2017. In this role, she successfully spearheaded a new sexual harassment law which allows for on the spot fines to be issued to men who catcall, harass or follow women on the street.Her appearance has drawn criticism from political colleagues including French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne.Borne pulled up Schiappa over the cover, telling her it “wasn’t appropriate, especially during this period,” CNN affiliate BFMTV reported Saturday, citing a source close to the prime minister.France is currentlyin the throes of a political and social crisistriggered byFrench President Emmanuel Macron’s move to push ahead with controversial pension reforms despite widespread public opposition.Video Ad FeedbackTrash is piling up on the streets of Paris.

(AP Photo/Thomas Padilla)Thomas Padilla/APRelated articleFrance wracked by more pension protests amid rising violence on the streetsFrench politician, Jean Luc Mélenchon who came third in the 2022 presidential elections criticized both Schiappa’s appearance and the decision by French President Emmanuel Macron to give an interview to children’s magazine, Pif Gadget, this week.“In a country where the President expresses himself in Pif and his minister in Playboy, the problem would be the opposition. France is going off the rails,” Mélenchon tweeted Saturday.Schiappa responded to her critics in a tweet on Saturday, saying: “Defending the right of women to have control of their bodies, that’s everywhere and all the time. In France, women are free. With all due respect to the detractors and hypocrites.”French Interior Minister, Gérald Darmanin came to Schiappa’s defense during an interview with French news channel CNews on Sunday calling her a “woman of character.”“I wanted to say that Marlene Schiappa is a courageous female politician who has her character and who has her style which is not mine, but I respect,” he remarked."

Now, it’s enjoying a comeback.Sterling hit its highest level against the US dollar in 10 months on Tuesday, topping $1.25 for the first time since June 2022. The pound, which has advanced about 3.3% versus the greenback since the start of 2023, is the best-performing currency among developed economies this year.The UK currency has been boosted by indications the country’s economy is holding up better than expected. Activity is now thought to have expanded 0.1% in the final three months of last year, up from a previous estimate of no growth at all. Gross domestic product growth in January has been estimated at 0.3% after dropping 0.5% in December.This resilience is bolstering expectations the Bank of England will maintain aggressive interest rate hikes despite concerns about the health of the global banking sector. Rising rates can boost the domestic currency because they help attract foreign investors searching for higher returns.Inflation in the United Kingdom alsojumped to an annual rate of 10.4% in February, underscoring the need for the Bank of England to maintain its tough approach.The pound turnaroundThe pound plunged close to $1.03 in September 2022 after the Truss government unveiled plans to boost borrowing while slashing taxes, unleashing panic in financial markets that fueled fears of a recession in the United Kingdom.The International Monetary Fund predicted in January that the UK economy would contract by 0.6% this year, while all other advanced economies would grow, if only slightly.“There was a lot of pessimism being priced into the pound,” said Francesco Pesole, a currency strategist at ING.But the sharp pullback in energy prices and China’s reopening have provided some relief about the economic outlook since the start of the year.“There was a big re-rating of growth expectations around Europe, and that impacted the UK,” Pesole said.The euro has also been lifted by these dynamics, rising 2.3% against the US dollar in 2023. The pound’s rally has been sharper in large part because its 2022 declines were more severe, according to Pesole.Both currencies have been aided by the greenback’s sharp drop from highs reached last September as recession fears have percolated in the United States.A lack of clarity around the Federal Reserve’s next steps has also restrained the dollar in recent weeks. Investor speculation has increased that the Fed could pause or stop rate hikes due to concerns about the economy following the failure of Silicon Valley Bank last month.Jordan Rochester, a currency strategist at Nomura, said he thinks the pound could rise to $1.30 this year and “potentially higher.” But he still sees risks given the uncertainty surrounding the Bank of England’s plans and how rate rises will feed back through the country’s economy. And Pesole cautioned that currency fluctuations are often overdone when markets are choppy, as they are now.“In a "

Company insiders said the exploits were utilized to spy on users and competitors, allegedly to boost sales.“We haven’t seen a mainstream app like this trying to escalate their privileges to gain access to things that they’re not supposed to gain access to,” said Mikko Hyppönen, chief research officer at WithSecure, a Finnish cybersecurity firm.“This is highly unusual, and it is pretty damning for Pinduoduo.”This is highly unusual, and it is pretty damning for Pinduoduo.Mikko Hyppönen, cybersecurity expertMalware, short for malicious software, refers to any software developed to steal data or interfere with computer systems and mobile devices.Evidence of sophisticated malware in the Pinduoduo app comes amid intense scrutiny of Chinese-developed apps like TikTok over concerns about data security.Some American lawmakers are pushing for anational banon the popular short-video app, whose CEO Shou Chewwas grilledby Congress for five hours last week about its relations with the Chinese government.The revelations are also likely to draw more attention to Pinduoduo’s international sister app, Temu, which istopping US download chartsand fast expanding in other Western markets. Both are owned by Nasdaq-listed PDD, a multinational company with roots in China.While Temu has not been implicated, Pinduoduo’s alleged actions risk casting a shadow over its sister app’s global expansion.There is no evidence that Pinduoduo has handed data to the Chinese government. But as Beijing enjoys significant leverage over businesses under its jurisdiction,there are concernsfrom US lawmakers that any company operating in China could be forced to cooperate with a broad range of security activities.Pinduoduo's parent company PDD is listed on the Nasdaq in New York.Mike Segar/Reuters/FileThe findings followGoogle’s suspensionof Pinduoduo from its Play Store in March, citing malware identified in versions of the app.Anensuing reportfrom Bloomberg said a Russian cybersecurity firm had also identified potential malware in the app.Pinduoduo haspreviously rejected“the speculation and accusation that Pinduoduo app is malicious.”CNN has contacted PDD multiple times over email and phone for comment, but has not received a response.Rise to successPinduoduo, which boasts a user base that accounts for three quarters of China’s online population anda market value three times that of eBay(EBAY), wasn’t always an online shopping behemoth.Founded in 2015 in Shanghai byColin Huang, a former Google employee, the startup was fighting to establish itself in a market long dominated by e-commerce stalwarts Alibaba(BABA)and JD.com(JD).It succeeded by offering steep discounts on friends-and-family group buying orders and focusing on lower-income rural areas.Pinduoduo posted triple digitgrowthin monthly users until the end of 2018, the yearit listedin New York. By the middle of 2020, though, the increase in monthly users had slowed to around 50% and would continue to decline, according to itsearnings reports.Colin Huang, a former Google employee, founded Pinduoduo in 2015 in Shanghai. He  stepped down as CEO in 2020 and resigned as chairman the following year.VCG/VCG/Getty Images/FileIt was in 2020, according to a current Pinduoduo employee, that the company set up a team of about 100 engineers and product managers to dig for vulnerabilities in Android phones, develop ways to exploit them — and turn that into profit.According to the source, who requested anonymity for fear of reprisals, the company only targeted users in rural areas and smaller towns initially, while avoiding users in megacities such as Beijing and Shanghai.“The goal was to reduce the risk of being exposed,” they said.By collecting expansive data on user activities, the company was able to create a comprehensive portrait of users’ habits, interests and preferences, according to the source.This allowed it to improve its machine learning model to offer more personalized push notifications and ads, attracting users to open the app and place orders, they said.The team was disbanded in early Ma"

Here are the key takeawaysStrategy and consulting firmSimon Kucher’s Global Sustainability Study 2021found 60% of consumers around the world rated sustainability as an important purchase criterion, and 35% were willing to pay more for sustainable products or services.This shift in consumer preferences has propelledmany beauty brands to set environmental goals: to move away fromsingle-use and virgin plastics, provide recyclable, reusable and refillable packaging and offer more transparency around products’ ingredients so customers can ascertain how “green” their purchase is.However, consumers still struggle to understand the sustainability credentials of many products, according to the British Beauty Council. This is because the industry’s clean-up efforts have been inconsistent, and fall short of making a recognizable impact in the absence of collective goal-setting, global strategy and standardized regulations.Ingredient and branding transparencyThere is no international standard for the beauty industry on how much product ingredient information to share with customers — or how to do so. Brands can set their own rules and goals, giving rise to confusion and“greenwashing,”where sustainability claims are often touted but not substantiated.Companies often use marketing language like“clean beauty”to make it seem like their products are natural, for example, when they may not actually be organic, sustainable or ethically made.Related articleAfter rebranding in the West, many beauty companies are still offering to 'whiten' skin elsewhere“The term ‘clean beauty’ has become quite dangerous. It’s used to sell more products,” according to British Beauty Council CEO Millie Kendall, who added that such buzzwords are losing traction in the UK as British customers wise up to their shortcomings. “Customers need better marketing information and certification information.”In a2021 report calling on the industry to have “the courage to change”their business practices, the British Beauty Council wrote that, all too often, even natural ingredients involved in manufacturing products give way to “over-consumption, non-regenerative farming practices, pollution, waste and neglect.”“The only way out of this is transparency,” Kendall told CNN.Jen Lee, chief impact officer at US-based brand Beautycounter, said she continues to see confusion over ingredients among consumers. (In 2013, the company launched and published “The Never List,” which currently cites more than 2,800 chemicals —including heavy metals, parabens and formaldehyde— it claims to never use in its products.)“Natural vs. synthetic ingredients has been a conversation. People think natural is safer, but it’s not always the case,” Lee explained. “Natural ingredients formulated in the industry can have toxic load. Heavy metals can occur in natural components of the earth.”Related articleMother loses peripheral vision from apparent exposure to mercury in beauty creams. Toxic levels in her home put family at risk, say experts“We used to be more natural and organic,” added Sasha Plavsic, founder of makeup brand ILIA Beauty. “What was challenging is (that) raw materials were difficult to source or would come in inconsistently or products wouldn’t perform.”Most makeup is created and molded at high temperatures, Plavsic explained. Purely organic materials often fall apart in this heat, leading to inconsistent results and subpar product performance. “Not every synthetic is bad,” Plavsic said. “Sometimes, it helps create the best in class formula.”Unpacking plasticsThe industry’s plastic packaging isa particular sustainability challenge— 95% is thrown away and the vast majority is not recycled, according to the British Beauty Council.The cosmetics business is the fourth biggest plastic packaging user globally — after food and beverage, industrial packaging and pharmaceuticals — and plastic is about 67% of the industry’s packaging volume, according to Vantage Market Research. Beauty giant L’Oreal used144,430 metric tons of plasticin its packaging material in 2021, for example, according to the Ellen Macarthur Foundation (EMF). Estee Lauder Companies reported its brands produced 71,600 metric tons of plastic in product packaging that same year.And only 9% of the global plastic waste is recycled, according to a report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The United Statesonly recycles 4% of its plastic waste.Related articleSingle-use plastic is wreaking havoc on the planet.

    "full_content": "Researchers are working on new alternatives to injected vaccines for Covid-19.Hou Yu/China News Service/VCG/Getty ImagesCNN—Scientists in Germany say they’ve been able to make a nasal vaccine that can shut down a Covid-19 infection in the nose and throat, where thevirus gets its first footholdin the body.In experiments in hamsters, two doses of the vaccine – which is made with a live but weakened form of the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 – blocked the virus from copying itself in the animals’ upper airways, achieving “sterilizing immunity” and preventing illness, a long-sought goal of the pandemic.Young Female doctor in protective mask injecting or prepairing for injecting vaccine against coronavirus or ncov 19 or covid into patient's armAdobe StockRelated articleWHO experts revise Covid-19 vaccine advice, say healthy kids and teens low riskAlthough this vaccine has several more hurdles to clear before it gets to a doctor’s office or drug store, other nasal vaccines are in use or are nearing the finish line in clinical trials.China and India both rolled out vaccines given through the nasal tissues last fall, though it’s not clear how well they may be working.  Studies on the effectiveness of these vaccines have yet to be published, leaving much of the world to wonder whether this approach to protection really works in people.Halting progress on next-generation Covid-19 vaccinesThe US has reached something of a stalemate with Covid-19. Even with the darkest days of the pandemic behind us, hundreds of Americans are still dying daily as the infection continues to simmer in the background of our return to normal life.As long as the virus continues to spread among people and animals, there’s always the potential for it mutate into a more contagious or more damaging version of itself.  And while Covid infections have become manageable for most healthy people, they may still pose a danger to vulnerable groups such as the elderly and immunocompromised.Researchers hope next-generation Covid-19 vaccines, which aim to shut down the virus before it ever gets a chance to make us sick and ultimately prevent the spread of infection, could make our newest resident respiratory infection less of a threat.Adobe StockRelated articleChina approves its first mRNA Covid-19 vaccineOne way scientists are trying to do that is by boosting mucosal immunity, beefing up immune defenses in the tissues that line the upper airways, right where the virus would land and begin to infect our cells.It’s a bit like stationing firefighters underneath the smoke alarm in your house, says study author Emanuel Wyler, a scientist at the Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association in Berlin.The immunity that’s created by shots works throughout the body, but it resides primarily in the blood. That means it may take longer to mount a response.“If they are already on site, they can immediately eliminate the fire, but if they’re like 2 miles away, they first need to drive there, and by that time, one-third of the house is already in full flames,” Wyler said.Mucosal vaccines are also better at priming a different kind of first responder than injections do.  They do a better job of summoning IgA antibodies, which have four arms to grab onto invaders instead of the two arms that the y-shaped IgG antibodies have.  Some scientists think IgA antibodies may be less picky about their targets than IgG antibodies, which makes them better equipped to deal with new variants.The new nasal vaccine takes a new approach to a very old idea: weakening a virus so it’s no longer a threat and then giving it to people so their immune systems can learn to recognize and fight it off. The first vaccines using this approach date to the 1870s, against anthrax and rabies.  Back then, scientists weakened the agents they were using with heat and chemicals.The researchers manipulated the genetic material in the virus to make it harder for cells to translate. This technique, called codon pair deoptimization, hobbles the virus so it can be shown to the immune system without making the body sick.“You could imagine reading a text … and every letter is a different font, or every letter is a different size, then the text is much harder to read. And this is basically what we do in codon pair deoptimization,” Wyler said.Promising results in animal studiesIn the hamster studies, which were published Monday in the journalNature Microbiology, two doses of the live but weakened nasal vaccine created a much stronger immune response than either two doses of an mRNA-based vaccine or one that uses an adenovirus to ferry the vaccine instructions into cells.The researchers think the live weakened vaccine probably worked better because it closely mimics the process of a natural infection.The nasal vaccine also previews the entire coronavirus for the body, not just its spike proteins like current Covid-19 vaccines do, so the hamsters were able to make immune weapons against a"

Its former leaderSelahattin Demirtashas been in prison for nearly seven years and the party faces possible closure by a court for suspected collusion with the militant Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) and affiliated groups. But its influence may nonetheless determine the course of Turkey’s politics.The HDP’s decision not to field a candidate came just three days after head of the Republican People’s Party (CHP)Kemal Kilicdaroglu, Erdogan’s main rival, visited the party’s co-chairs. He told reporters that the solution to Turkey’s problems, “including the Kurdish problem” lies in parliament,” according to Turkish media.Kilicdaroglu, who represents the six-party Nation Alliance opposition bloc, is the strongest contender to run against Erdogan in years. And while the HDP hasn’t yet announced whether it will put its weight behind him, analysts say it is the kingmaker in the elections.Turkey's main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu and his wife Selvi Kilicdaroglu pose to the media during a rally on May 21, 2022 in Istanbul, Turkey.Burak Kara/Getty Images/FileRelated articleErdogan's 'polar opposite' wants to replace him as president of Turkey“It was a carefully crafted political discourse,” Hisyar Ozsoy, deputy co-chair of the HDP and a member of parliament from the predominantly Kurdish province of Diyarbakir, told CNN. “We are not going to have our own candidate, and we will leave it to the international community to interpret it the way they wish.”Experts say the crackdown on the HDP is rooted in the threat it poses to Erdogan politically, as well as its position as one of the main parties representing Turkey’s Kurds,an ethnic minorityfrom which a separatist militant movement has emerged.The party and the Kurdish people have had a complicated relationship with Erdogan. The leader courted the Kurds in earlier years by granting them more rights and reversing restrictions on the use of their language. Relations with the HDP were also cordial once, as Erdogan worked with the party on a brief peace process with the PKK.But ties between Erdogan and the HDP later turned sour, and the HDP fell under a sweeping crackdown aimed at the PKK and their affiliates.Kurds are the biggest minority in Turkey, making up between 15% and 20% of the population, according to Minority Rights Group International.It is unclear if the HDP will endorse Kilicdaroglu, but analysts say that the deliberate distance may be beneficial for the opposition candidate.Precarious positionThe accusations against the HDP place it in a precarious position during the elections. It currently faces a case in Turkey’s Constitutional Court over suspected ties to the PKK, which is designated as a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. Knowing it may be banned at any moment, its candidates are running under the Green Left Party in parliament.If the opposition is seen as allying with the HDP, Erdogan’s AK Party may use its influence in the media to discredit it as being pro-PKK, said Murat Somer, a political science professor at Koc University in Istanbul and author of Return to Point Zero, a book on the Turkish-Kurdish question in Turkey.The HDP’s threat to Erdogan’s hold on power became apparent after the June 2015 election, the first general election it participated in. It won 13% of the seats, denying the ruling AK Party its majority for the first time since 2002. Erdogan, however, called a snap election five months later, which led to a drop in the HDP’s support to 10.7%, as well as the restoratio"

After a pause during lockdown, lenders from Citigroup Inc. to HSBC Holdings Plc have restarted cuts, taking gross losses announced this year to a combined 63,785 jobs, according to a Bloomberg analysis of filings. Photographer: Simon Dawson/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesSimon Dawson/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesRelated articleHSBC's biggest shareholder reignites debate about breaking up the bankTucker said the board was unanimous in its opposition to the resolution, stating plainly: “It would not be in your interest to split the bank.”He said the board had previously reviewed a range of options for restructuring the bank, and concluded that such alternatives would “materially destroy value for shareholders,” including dividends.“Our strategy is working,” Tucker told the room of more than 1,000 shareholders. “Our current strategy is moving dividends up.”Calls for a breakupHSBC has been facing calls to separate its Asian business from the rest of the bank over the past year.Shareholders in Hong Kong — where HSBC is a mainstay of many retail investors’ portfolios — contend that the London-based lender’s performance has been dragged down by itsbusinesses in other regions.Quinn addressed those complaints head-on Monday, saying “our profits in Hong Kong and the UK are no longer being dragged down by underperformance elsewhere. The group is performing well as a whole.”Pressed later by a shareholder on the issue, Quinn said a breakup of the bank would result in “significant revenue loss”  because much of its business relied on cross-border transactions.Mark Tucker, chairman of HSBC, left, and Peter Wong, chairman of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, departing following the bank's shareholders meeting in Hong Kong on Monday.Paul Yeung/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesInvestors have also been unhappy with HSBCscrapping its dividendin 2020, at the request of British regulators. They argue that if the lender cordoned off its activities in Asia, it would no longer have to expose Hong Kong shareholders to requests in other jurisdictions.Christine Fong, a district council member in Hong Kong, said she represented about 500 small shareholders who had been affected by the dividend cancellation.“Street hawkers, taxi drivers or teachers — they all relied on the dividend to pay for their regular expenses, like mortgage, insurance payments, school fees,” Fong told CNN.“That’s why, three years ago, what HSBC did upset those small minority shareholders.”Fong has now joined calls for shareholders to vote in favor of the proposal for the bank to spin off its Asian business, despite the lenderbringing back its dividendin 2021, albeit at a lower level.An HSBC bank branch in Hong Kong last July. HSBC is a mainstay of many retail investors' portfolios in the city, which is also its top market.Louise Delmotte/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesKen Lui, an activist shareholder in Hong Kong who put the resolution together, doubled down on his call for support ahead of the meeting Monday.The resolution will require 75% of votes to be passed in May, but “nothing is impossible,” he told reporters outside the meeting venue.Lui, who said he personally held a stake worth 100 million Hong Kong dollars ($12.7 million), laid out plans for his team to focus on “targeted outreach to institutional shareholders to present our case and gain their support.”His group will also canvass 18 districts of Hong Kong “to tell HSBC shareholders that they finally have a chance to speak for themselves and protect their rights through voting,” he added.The Ping An questionHSBC is also facing pressure from its largest shareholder.Ping An(PNGAY), China’s biggest insurer, holds an 8% stake in HSBC and has backed calls for the bank to rethink its structure.In a series ofremarksmade public by the Chinese firm last November, Huang Yong, chairman of Ping An’s asset management arm, said “we will support any initiatives including a spinoff that are conducive to improve H"

In 2019, theycalledabortion bans “bad for business.”After the deadly attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, many of corporate America’s biggest names denounced the rioters andpledgedto halt their political giving.Recently, more than 1,000 companies promised to voluntarilycurtailtheir operations in Russia in protest of Moscow’s war on Ukraine.Dick’s Sporting Goodsstopped sellingsemi-automatic, assault-style rifles at stores and Citigroup putnew restrictionson gun sales by business customers after the mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, in 2018.A year later, after mass shootings at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, and a nightclub in Dayton, Ohio,Walmart ended handgun ammunition sales.Corporate leadership has long been vocal on the issue of gun control – in 2019 and again this pastsummernearly 150 major companies – including Lululemon, Lyft, Bain Capital, Bloomberg LP, Permanente Medical Group and Unilever – called gun violence a “public health crisis” and demanded that the US Senate pass legislation toaddress it.That’s why corporate America’ssilencein the wake of the latest mass shooting at a school in Nashville is so jarring. The United States has come to rely on the increasing power of large corporations as political advocates.But Yale professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, avocal advocate of corporate social responsibilitywho has a direct line to major CEOs around the globe, said that top executives are forlorn. Their previous efforts haven’t done much to push the needle on gun control legislation and without more backing, they don’t know what else they can do at the moment, he said.Before the Bell spoke with Sonnenfeld, who runs Yale School of Management’s Chief Executive Leadership Institute, a nonprofit educational and research institute focused on CEO leadership and corporate governance.This interview has been edited for clarity and length.Before the Bell: CEOs have been quiet about gun reform since the latest mass school shooting in Nashville, have you heard anything about plans to speak out?Jeffrey Sonnenfeld:Where is everybody else? Where is all of civil society? CEOs are just one group of people and it’s like we’re turning to them to be our saviors on every topic. They’ve joined causes with valor and nobility but they can’t just be taking cause after cause as if there’s nobody else in society. The social change that happened in the 1960s wasn’t being led primarily by CEOs. Social changes really happened when we saw the int"

A primary purpose is to provide survivors with an opportunity to grieve and gain a sense of closure. The cemetery is a place for the living as much as it is a place for the dead.But what about when the dearly departed are not human – but our pets?Eric TourignyEric TourignyThe Spanish city of Barcelona recently announced that it will be investing in the establishment of thecountry’s first public pet cemetery.Set to open next year, it will offer both burials and cremations – with an estimated 7,000 carried out each year.For me, as someone who has spent years researching the development of pet cemeteries elsewhere in the world, this news came as a shock. Barcelona is a densely populated city with limited privately owned land – one where50% of families own a pet.How did a city that ishome to 180,000 dogsnot already have a public pet cemetery? Until now, the service was only provided by the private sector,according toBarcelona’s Councilor for Climate Emergency and Ecological Transition, Eloi Badia. He added that the municipal-funded initiative was sparked by “constant public demand.”After all, public pet cemeteries have been around in Europe and the Americassince the late 19th century.Britain’s first public pet cemetery appeared in London’s Hyde Park in 1881. New York’s Hartsdale pet cemetery was founded in 1896, followed a few years later by Paris’ ornate Cimetière des Chiens in 1899.A grave discoveryI became interested in the history of modern pet burial practices while investigating the archaeological record of a centuries-old house in Toronto. I came across a (very) large dog buried in the back garden which, according to the historical record, was occupied between 1840 and 1870.This dog survived to an elderly age but, sadly, suffered from degenerative joint disease and severe infections during his last months. His ailments progressed to such a state that suggest he received some level of care in his final weeks. He then was buried in a personal plot behind the family home.This elderly dog led me to think about the different ways people interact with the bodies of their pets after death. Could this behavior be reflective of the relationships they held with their animals in life? In this instance, why take the time to carefully bury a dog in its own space when other, arguably easier options existed?\"Darling Sammie,\" reads one of the animal gravestones dating back to the 1890s in Hyde Park Pet Cemetery, London. Photo taken by Eric Tourigny with permission from The Royal Parks.Eric TourignyThis, after all, was an era when people often disposed of their dead pets in the river, or might have sold their bodies for meat and skin.Good hygiene is an obvious reason to choose a burial – no one wants decomposing animal bodies in the street or their garden – but that wouldn’t immediately warrant a personalized, dedicated burial and gravestone.The most straight forward option would be to dispose of a deceased animal with the household waste. But such treatment would evidently feel less ceremonious and would not offer appropriate emotional closure to what was likely an important relationship.A member of the familyLike the burial of people, the burial of pets is an intimate cultural practice, one that changes over time and is reflective of the changing relationships that a society has with its cherished creatures.Mystudy of historic gravestones and epitaphs in Britainfrom the Victorian period to today shows this changing human-animal relationship. In the 19th century, gravestones were often dedicated to a “loving friend” or “devoted companion,” suggesting pets were mostly considered important friends.By the early 20th century, pets had become members of the family – evidenced by the appearance of family surnames on the gravestones, and loving epitaphs written by “Mummy and Daddy.”By the early 20th century, pets had become members of the family – evidenced by the appearance of family surnames on the gravestones, and loving epitaphs written by “Mummy and Daddy.”Eric TourignySociety’s changing attitude towards the role of animals in the afterlife can also be found. Fast-forward a few decades later, and gravestones were more likely to reference a reunion then earlier ones. For example, the owners of Denny, the “brave little cat” buried in an east London cemetery in 1952, wrote on his epitaph “God bless until we meet again.”I wonder what the ep"

Snailfish are members of Liparidae family, and while most snailfish live in shallow water, others survive at some of the greatest depths ever recorded, Jamieson said.During the two-month survey last year, three “landers” – automatic sea robots fitted with high-resolution cameras – were dropped into three trenches – the Japan, Izu-Ogasawara and Ryukyu trenches – at varying depths.In the Izu-Ogasawara trench, footage showed the deepest snailfish hovering calmly alongside other crustaceans on the seabed.Jamieson classified the fish as a juvenile and said younger deep sea snailfish often stay as deep as possible to avoid being eaten by bigger predators that swim at shallower depths.Another clip shot at between 7,500 and 8,200 meters in the same trench showed a colony of fish and crustaceans munching at bait tied to an undersea robot.Images of the two captured snailfish – identified asPseudoliparis belyaevi– provide a rare glimpse of the unique features that help the deep sea species survive the extreme environment.They have tiny eyes, a translucent body, and their lack of swim bladder, which helps other fish float, works to their advantage, Jamieson said.The professor said the Pacific Ocean is particularly conducive to vibrant activity due to its warm southern current, which encourages sea creatures to go deeper, while its abundant marine life provides a good source of food for bottom feeders.Scientists would like to know more about creatures living at extreme depths, but cost is the constraint, Jamieson said, adding that each lander alone costs them $200,000 to assemble and operate.“The challenges are that technology has been expensive and scientists don’t have a lot of money,” he said."

The news sent both Brent crude futures, the global oil benchmark, and WTI, the US benchmark, up about 6% in trading Monday.The production cut announcement also had an immediate impact on gasoline futures, which will be passed onto US drivers much more quickly than the spike in oil prices. RBOB, the most closely watched wholesale gasoline price, was up about 8 cents a gallon, or about 3%, in morning trading.“I think OPEC is reawakening the inflation monster,” said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for OPIS, which tracks gas prices for AAA. “The White House has to be shocked and major-time pissed. It certainly alters the calculus for a while.”The national average for US gas prices stood at $3.51, on Monday, according to AAA. Kloza said he could see it getting up to $3.80 to $3.90 in relatively short order thanks to the move by OPEC.“We’re not going to get back to $5 a gallon. I don’t think we’re even going as high as $4,” he said. But he said by the end of the summer US drivers could be back above year-earlier prices, especially if there is a hurricane or other storms affecting production along the Gulf Coast.The average US regular gas price a year ago stood at $4.19 a gallon in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the disruption that caused to world’s energy markets. Prices eventually reached arecord $5.02 a gallon on June 14, before starting a slow but steady decline over the course of more than three months during which theaverage price fell every day. The decline was partly driven by the release of oil from theUS Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and partly by concerns that there could be a US or global recession that reduced the demand for gasoline.General view of Saudi Aramco's Ras Tanura oil refinery and oil terminal in Saudi Arabia May 21, 2018.Ahmed Jadallah/ReutersRelated articleOil prices surge after OPEC+ producers announce surprise cutsEven at $3.51, US gas prices were just below the $3.53 average on Feb. 23, 2022, the day before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Kloza said one thing keeping prices from getting anywhere near the record levels of 2022 is that the US plans additional releases from the SPR, and US oil production and refining capacity are both up. But a cut of 1 million barrels a day of oil by OPEC+ will not be easy to make up.“They have ability to cut production and they seem motivated to do so,” he said."

He won 55.41% of the votes on Sunday, beating two German candidates, Marco Strauss and Mathias Fey.Locals cheered the 29-year-old when he welcomed his win, a victory he described as “sensational,” German local broadcaster SWR reported Monday.“Today, Ostelsheim sent an example for broad-mindedness and cosmopolitanism for the whole of Germany,” he said, according to to German public broadcaster ZDF. “That’s not something that can be taken for granted in a conservative, rural area.”Alshebl’s first call after his victory was to his mother in Syria, who was thrilled with the news, SWR reported.The Association of Municipalities of Baden-Württemberg said Alshebl is the first man with Syrian roots to run for and win a mayor’s office. He will start his role in June.Ivana Kottasova/CNNRelated article'You are not a refugee.' Roma refugees fleeing war in Ukraine say they are suffering discrimination and prejudiceOstelsheim residents have welcomed their incoming mayor. “The fairy tale has come true, and the right man has become our mayor,” Annette Keck, who lives in the village, told SWR.Strauss, one of his opponents, congratulated Alshebl. “I wish you good luck and at the same time ask for support for Mr. Alshebl, for our shared Ostelsheim,” he said on Facebook.The state’s Integration Minister Manne Lucha said that Alshebl’s victory showed that diversity is a natural part of Baden-Württemberg. “I would be very pleased if Ryyan Alshebl’s election encourages more people with a migration history to run for political office,” he said.Not everyone has been so warm to the 29-year-old. ZDF reported the Syrian received hateful comments on the campaign trail.The young politician went from house to house, promoting his election program, and “the experiences were predominantly positive,” but there was also a minority of far-right fringe voters in Ostelsheim that did not want to accept him due to his Syrian roots, Alshebl told ZDF.‘Investing in your future’Born to a schoolteacher and agricultural engineer in Syria, Alshebl described his life as carefree until the age of 20, according to his campaign website.At the time, protests against the Syrian government that began in 2011 soon devolved into chaotic war. The fighting and later rise of ISIS forced 10.6 million people from homeby late 2015– about half of Syria’s pre-war population.Alshebl faced the dilemma of being drafted for military service with the Syrian army or leaving the country, according to his website.While many Syrians were displaced internally or fled to countries in the region, others like Alshebl made the dangerous journey to Europe. He was 21 years old at the time, and said he crossed from Turkey to the Greek island of Lesbos in a rubber dinghy.Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel had implemented a brief open-door policy in 2015 that saw the country take in about 1.2 million asylum seekers in the following years, including Alshebl.Children wait in line to receive gifts from St. Nicholas at a celebration in Henley-on-Thames on December 19.Toby Hancock/CNNRelated articleThey were welcomed into British homes.

He drew from his experience, he said in his campaign, and made digital access to to public administration services one of priorities. Flexible childcare and climate protections are also on his agenda.Alshebl, who is a member of the Green Party and now has German citizenship, pledged during his campaign that once elected as mayor he would move to Ostelsheim."

Genetics may be a factor, but some have been looking at potential environmental causes, too.Lonely little girl near window indoors.

It’s used in batteries, grease and air conditioners, as well as in the treatment of bipolar disorder and some blood disorders. Its levels in US drinking water are not regulated,according to the US Geological Survey.Anew study,published Monday in the journal JAMA Pediatrics, found a small association between lithium and autism diagnosis in Denmark, where the researchers say the level of lithium in drinking water is similar to that in American water systems.The researchers checked a database of people with psychiatric disorders for children born between 2000 and 2013 to find information on 8,842 cases of ASD and 43,864 participants who did not have ASD. They then measured the concentration of lithium in 151 public waterworks that served more than half of the Danish population and mapped out where pregnant people lived in relation.A screenshot from The Sims 4From The SimsRelated articleFor many neurodiverse people, 'The Sims' has been a lifelong comfortAs lithium levels in water increased, there was a modest increased risk of an ASD diagnosis. Specifically, compared with people at the lowest exposure level, those who had the second and third highest exposure during pregnancy had a 24% to 26% higher risk of ASDdiagnosed in children. The group with the highest exposure had a 46% higher risk than those at the lowest level of exposure.The researchers could not tell how much water the pregnant people drank, but they picked Denmark in part because residents there consume some of the lowest amounts of bottled water in Europe.Experts say it’s important to note that the research can’t show that lithium exposure leads directly to an autism diagnosis.Further study is required, said study co-author Dr. Beate Ritz, a professor of neurology in the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, and a professor of epidemiology and environmental health at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health.“Any drinking water contaminants that may affect the developing human brain deserve intense scrutiny,” Ritz said in a news release. She added that the research would need to be replicated in other countries to look for a similar connection.The implications of the findings are complex as far as public health policy is concerned, according to an editorial published alongside the study. Lithium levels in water, at concentrations that the study associated with a potential ASD risk, have also been linked withhealth benefitssuch as lower rates of hospitalization for psychiatric disorders and suicide.“If all these of associations are valid, the wisdom of Solomon will be required to develop guidelines for lithium in drinking water that are maximally protective of the entire population,” wrote Dr. David C. Bellinger, a professor of neurology and psychology at Harvard Medical School. “Until the basic biology of ASD is better understood, it will be difficult to distinguish causal from spurious associations.”Brandie Kurtz of Wrens, Georgia, said her son Wylie James Prescott had to wait more than a year after his autism diagnosis to begin behavioral therapy, even though research shows early treatment of autism can be crucial for children's long-term development.Courtesy Brandie KurtzRelated article'Heartbreaking' delays in autism diagnosis and treatment got even worse during pandemicDr. Max Wiznitzer, director of the Rainbow Autism Center at University Hospitals Rainbow Babies and Children’s Hospital in Cleveland, points to other research on the effects of lithium on pregnant people who take it for mental health disorders.

He attended the School of Industrial Art (now the High School of Art and Design) and, according to profiles of Brathwaite inT MagazineandVice, was drawn to photography by two moments. The first was in August of 1955, when a 17-year-old Brathwaite encountered David Jackson’s haunting photograph of a brutalized Emmett Till in his open casket. The second was in 1956, when — after he and his brother Elombe co-founded the African Jazz Arts Society and Studios (AJASS) — Brathwaite saw a young man taking photos in a dark jazz club without the use of a flash, and his mind became alight with possibility.Brathwaite's photograph of models who embraced their natural hair, photographed in 1966.Courtesy The Kwame Brathwaite ArchiveUsing a Hasselblad medium-format camera, Brathwaite attempted to do the same, learning to work with limited light in a manner that enhanced the visual narrative of his imagery. He would soon also develop a darkroom technique that enriched and deepened how Black skin would appear in his photography, honing the practice in a small darkroom in his Harlem apartment. Brathwaite went on to photograph jazz legends performing throughout the 1950s and ’60s, including Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Thelonious Monk and others.“You want to get the feeling, the mood that you’re experiencing when they’re playing,” Brathwaite toldAperture Magazinein 2017. “That’s the thing. You want to capture that.”Related articleA 106-year-old from the Philippines is Vogue's oldest ever cover modelBy the early 1960s, alongside the rest of AJASS, Brathwaite began using his photography and organizing prowess to consciously push back against whitewashed, Eurocentric beauty standards. The group came up with the concept of the Grandassa Models, young Black women whom Brathwaite would photograph, celebrating and accentuating their features. In 1962, AJASS organized “Naturally ’62”, a fashion show held in a Harlem club called the Purple Manor and featuring the models. The show would go on to be held regularly until 1992. In 1966, Brathwaite married his wife Sikolo, a Grandassa Model whom he had met on the street the year prior when he asked if he could take her portrait. The two remained married for the rest of Brathwaite’s life.Women in a car gathered for Garvey Day, the annual event commemorating Black activist Marcus Garvey.Courtesy The Kwame Brathwaite ArchiveBy the 1970s, Brathwaite’s focus on jazz shifted to other forms of popular Black music. In 1974, he traveled to Africa with the Jackson Five to document their tour, also photographing the historic “Rumble in the Jungle” boxing match between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman in what’s now the Democratic Republic of Congo that same year. Commissions in this era also saw Brathwaite photographing Nina Simone, Stevie Wonder, Sly and the Family Stone, Bob Marley and other music legends.Related articleCreating for community: The Black designers placing identity and heritage at the center of their brandsThroughout the ensuing decades, Brathwaite continued to explore and develop his mode of photography, all through the lens of the “Black is Beautiful” ethos. In 2016, Brathwaite joined the roster of Philip Martin Gallery in Los Angeles, and he was continuing to photograph commissions as recently as 2018, when he shot artist and stylist Joanne Petit-Frère forThe New Yorker.T Magazine’s 2021 profile, published on the occasion of Brathwaite’s retrospective traveling to the Blanton Museum of Art in Austin, Texas, noted that the photographer’s health was failing such that he was unable to be interviewed for the article. A separate exhibition, “Kwame Brathwaite: Things Well Worth Waiting For,” is currently on view at the Art Institute of Chicago, where it will remain until July 24.Top image: Kwame Brathwaite, “Untitled (Sikolo Brathwaite, Orange Portrait),” 1968"

    "full_content": "The haggis is as beloved in Scotland as it is feared in other parts of the world.exclusive-design/Adobe StockCNN—Anthony Bourdain loved haggis. But even the late, great American chef, writer and television host recognized that Scotland’s national dish, with its “sinister sheep parts” wrapped in a shroud of mystery and half-invented history, could be a hard sell.“Don’t let them tell you otherwise, that’s really one of life’s great pleasures,” Bourdain said on one of his gastro-curious pilgrimages to Glasgow. “There is no more unfairly reviled food on Earth than the haggis.”A mash-up of diced lung, liver and heart mixed with oatmeal, beef suet, onion and assorted spices, haggis was traditionally made by stuffing these raw ingredients into the stomach of a recently slain sheep and boiling the lot to a state of palatability.Instagrammableis not the word that immediately comes to mind. In our 21st-century world, where “clean” eating and processed pap overlap, haggis can seem like an “Outlander”-style outlier from another age.Yet, by some alchemy, once cooked to its required “warm-reekin’ (steaming)” state, it adds up to much more than the sum of its modest parts. It’s offaly charm has kept nose-to-tail eating alive among a younger generation of Scots that has largely turned its back on the tripe, liver and kidneys their predecessors enjoyed (or endured).Carefully prepared, haggis tastes both oaty and meaty; it is dark and crumbly, a little crispy at the edges but still moist; earthy but also savory and spicy; deep-tasting and profoundly warming, the perfect foil for its traditional garnish of floury mashed potatoes and orange bashed turnip.“It’s like a cuddle for the stomach,” says Nicola Turner, a 35-year-old office administrator from Helensburgh, a town on western Scotland’s Firth of Clyde.Spice and textureHaggis is traditionally served with turnips.Jeff J Mitchell/Getty ImagesFor children of the 1960s and ’70s, like crime novelist Ian Rankin, haggis meals were a choice between the classic meat-and-two-veg plate and the battered and deep-fried, chip-shop iteration loved by both his friend Bourdain and his quintessentially Scottish detective character, Inspector John Rebus.Now myriad other treatments have blossomed.“I’m pretty sure the first time I dined with AB in Edinburgh we had haggis in filo pastry with a jam-style – maybe blackcurrant – sauce,” Rankin recalled. “He was a big fan of haggis and of chip shops. Rebus will have enjoyed the occasional haggis supper from his local chip shop. He was definitely a fan, as am I.”“It is all about the spicing and the texture,” says the Scottish food writer, novelist and cook Sue Lawrence, a champion of haggis’ adaptability for use in other dishes. “If you didn’t know what was in it, you wouldn’t think ‘oh that tastes of liver or whatever.’ It is all nicely chopped up and the oatmeal gives it a lovely texture. It could easily be a nice, big mince dish.”Related articleThese US restaurants and chefs are James Beard Award finalistsLawrence uses haggis as an alternative to beef and pork ragù in lasagna and in her pastilla, a version of the North African dish in which a hand-made haggis from the Isle of Mull substitutes for the traditional poultry or seafood filling. The filo pastry savory is flavored with the spice blend ras el hanout, apricots, chile, orange zest and almonds before being sprinkled with cinnamon and icing sugar.Such cultural crossovers serve as a reminder that haggis could easily be a dish with nothing specifically Scottish about it at all. Records of similar quick and portable preparations of the fast-perishing innards of sheep and other animals date back to ancient Rome and Greece.Haggis-like combinations of offal and grains are part of the culinary history of several countries. Spain has chireta, Romania drob and Sweden polsa, while chaudin, or ponce, is a rice and meat-stuffed pig stomach that is a staple of Cajun cooking.Wild wee beastieDeep-fried haggis is often a staple of Scottish fish and chip shops.Yarvin World Journeys/Alamy Stock PhotoIn neighboring England, recipes for “hagese,” “hagws of a schepe,” “haggas” or “haggus” pop up in recipe books published between the 15th and 17th centuries, probably preceding written records north of the border.Etymological evidence points to the term “haggis” having its roots in Old Norse, suggesting an early version of an oat-and-offal sausage might have arrived in Britain and Ireland on a Viking longboat.But ever since it was first optioned by the poet Robert Burns in the late 1700s, the haggis backstory has been monopolized by Scotland and the Scots, sometimes mischievously.It is, according to the kind of lore that Burns engendered, the dish a doughty Highlander would carry with him as he drove cattle through the glens to the markets of the central belt or the perfect picnic for a whisky smuggler plying his illicit trade by moonlight.Imports of Scottish haggis are banned from the United States.Russell Cheyne"

In order to stay verified, Musk said, users would have to pay $8 per month tojoin the platform’s Twitter Bluesubscription service, which has allowedaccounts to pay for verification since December.Most legacy blue check holders found this weekend that their verification marks had not disappeared,but rather had been appended with a new label reading: “This account is verified because it’s subscribed to Twitter Blue or is a legacy verified account.” The language, which shows up when users click on the check mark, makes it unclear whether verified accounts are actually notable individuals or simply users who have paid to join Twitter Blue.But one high-profile account did lose its blue check over the weekend: the main account for the New York Times, which hadpreviously told CNNit would not pay for verification.Jonathan Ernst/Reuters/Chris Carrasquillo/Variety/Getty ImagesRelated articleWilliam Shatner is mad he may have to pay to keep his blue Twitter checkmark.

    "full_content": "Graham Potter was sacked as Chelsea manager on Sunday.Harriet Lander/Getty ImagesCNN—It was just six months ago thatGraham Potterwas deemed the man to usher in a fresh, exciting era at Chelsea.The club’snew ownership group, led by American businessman Todd Boehly, had enticed Potter away from Brighton with the promise of managing one of the most lucrative teams in world soccer.More than $600 million was spent on bringing big-name players to the club and Potter, one of the most exciting young managers in the Premier League, was to mold them into a winning machine.LIVERPOOL, ENGLAND - JANUARY 21: Mykhailo Mudryk of Chelsea looks on during the Premier League match between Liverpool FC and Chelsea FC at Anfield on January 21, 2023 in Liverpool, England. (Photo by Laurence Griffiths/Getty Images)Laurence Griffiths/Getty Images Europe/Getty ImagesRelated articleChelsea has spent over $600 million on new signings. Here's why that's significantBut, on Sunday, the clubannouncedthat it had sacked its manager after an underwhelming spell in charge.Potter managed to win just 10 of the 28 league matches this season and leaves the team 11th in the Premier League table.In recent weeks, players had looked a shadow of their former selves and many fans had lost confidence that Potter’s plan for the club could ever work.Eventually, after previously sticking by its manager, Blues ownership agreed.“On behalf of everyone at the club, we want to thank Graham sincerely for his contribution to Chelsea,” the club’s co-owners Todd Boehly and Behdad Eghbali said in a statement.“We have the highest degree of respect for Graham as a coach and as a person. He has always conducted himself with professionalism and integrity and we are all disappointed in this outcome.”Chelsea's position in the league has nosedived in recent weeks.Marc Atkins/Getty ImagesIn his previous role as Brighton manager, Potter was given time to stamp his identity on the squad.The club was punching above its weight financially and, as a result, carefully selected new signings which would compliment Potter’s style of play.The approach paid off as the team became an established Premier League outfit which has gone on to greater things this season – the Seagulls currently sit sixth in the league and in the UEFA Conference League qualification spot.At Chelsea, it seemed the complete opposite.As was the case under previous owner Roman Abramovich, the club expected instant results and used its financial weight to sign a number of high-profile names, including the likes ofEnzo FernándezandMykhailo Mudryk.Despite his impressive CV, Potter had never managed superstars and suddenly found himself in a changing room with multiple.The scatter gun approach to recruitment also left the team lacking balance and organization with Potter failing to get a tune out of a team busting with talent.Premier League recordIn truth, many had raised an eyebrow when Potter, inexperienced at the very top level, was chosen to replaceThomas Tuchelas manager.Despite falling out of favor with fans by the end of his tenure, Tuchel had guided Chelsea to the Champions League title in 2021 and is still considered by many as one of the best coaches in the world.The German has gone on to sign with Bavarian giant Bayern Munich through the 2024/25 season and recently told reporters he needed “quite a bit of time to distance himself from Chelsea” because leaving the club had hurt him.Julian Nagelsmann at the UEFA Champions League on February 14, 2023 in Paris, France.Julian Finney/UEFA/Getty ImagesRelated articleBayern Munich sacks manager Julian Nagelsmann, appoints Thomas Tuchel“Todd [Boehly] said he would be different to Roman [Abramovich],” former Liverpool player and current pundit Jamie Carragher wrote onTwitter.“I feel for Graham Potter, but it was inevitable. You don’t change Tuchel for Potter. Ridiculous decision to start with.”With 10 games left in the league and a Champions League quarterfinal against Real Madrid on the horizon, Chelsea still has plenty to play for.Assistant coach Bruno Saltor will take over on an interim basis, but Boehly and his team must now look for a long-term replacement capable – and willing – to bring order to Chelsea’s chaos.Potter’s sacking is yet another sign of just how transient managers can be in the top-flight of English football, especially when results aren’t instantaneous.There has now been a record 12sackingsin the Premier League so far this season, with Potter leaving his position the same day Leicester boss Brendan Rodgers was sacked from his.The previous record was 10 manager changes in a single season, set in four other campaigns, most recently in 2017/18."

Some have criticized Reese, while others have defended her actions, highlighting how there was no public outrage in response to Clark’s gesture earlier in the tournament.Sports journalist Jose de Jesus Ortiz called Reese’s actions “classless,” while former ESPN host Keith Olbermann called Reese an “idiot” for the gesture.In the press conference after the victory, Reese referenced the difference in reaction she received as a result of her gesture as compared to the one Clark received.Caitlin Clark did the \"You can't see me\" gesture earlier in the NCAA tournament.From ESPN“All year, I was critiqued for who I was. I don’t fit the narrative,” Reese said. “I don’t fit the box that y’all want me to be in. I’m too hood. I’m too ghetto. Y’all told me that all year. But when other people do it, and y’all don’t say nothing.“So this is for the girls that look like me. For those that want to speak up for what they believe in. It’s unapologetically you. And that’s what I did it for tonight. It was bigger than me tonight. And Twitter is going to go into a rage every time.“And I’m happy. I feel like I’ve helped grow women’s basketball this year.

Shut up,” according to the Bleacher Report.“Caitlin Clark is a hell of a player but I don’t take disrespect lightly,” Reese said. “She disrespected [LSU’s] Alexis [Morris] (…) and I wanted to pick her pocket. But I had a moment at the end of her game. I was in my bag, I was in my moment.”After the Championship game, Clark herself said she didn’t notice anything at the time.“I was just trying to get to the handshake line and shake hands and be grateful that my team was in that position,” Clark said in the post-game press conference. “All the credit in the world to LSU. They were tremendous. They deserve it. They had a tremendous season.“(LSU head coach) Kim Mulkey coached them so, so well. She’s one of the best basketball coaches of all time, and it shows. She only said really kind things to me in the handshake line, so I’m very grateful of that too.“But honestly I have no idea. I was just trying to spend the last few moments on the court with especially the five people that I’ve started 93 games with and relishing every second of that.”LSU head coach Mulkey said she had “no clue” about what transpired.LSU players celebrate after winning the national championship game on Sunday, April 2.Tony Gutierrez/APLSU's Angel Reese gestures toward her ring finger in the final moments of the game.Maddie Meyer/Getty ImagesLSU's Flau'jae Johnson hugs head coach Kim Mulkey at the end of the game.Kevin Jairaj/USA Today Sports/ReutersLSU came into the tournament as a No. 3 seed, but it knocked off a 1-seed (Virginia Tech) and a 2-seed (Iowa) in the Final Four.Maddie Meyer/Getty ImagesLSU's Alexis Morris drives to the basket during the second half.

The nightmare then repeated itself for Palmer, who started strong before dropping four shots across a three-hole stretch to lose out by four strokes to Casper.Bettmann Archive/Getty ImagesEd Sneed, The Masters (1979)He wasn't related to Sam Snead, but Ed Sneed saw a major slip away in similarly catastrophic circumstances at The Masters in 1979. Three up with three to play, Sneed slumped to a trio of bogeys to fall into a sudden-death playoff at Augusta -- the first time the format had been used. Debutant Fuzzy Zoeller went on to clinch a one-stroke victory over Sneed and Tom Watson. While Watson would finish his career with eight major titles, including two Masters victories, 1979 would cruelly be the closest Sneed ever got to tasting major glory.Augusta National/Getty ImagesScott Hoch, The Masters (1989)Based on the distance Hoch had to putt to win the 1989 Masters, Nick Faldo had two feet in the grave. Locked in a sudden-death playoff at Augusta's 10th hole, Faldo could only find the bunker with his approach, leaving Hoch with two bites at a 25-foot putt to win. The American's first effort took him to within two feet of glory, only for his second to roll agonizingly around the lip of the hole. In response, an exasperated Hoch launched his putter skyward. When Faldo birdied at the subsequent hole, Hoch's hopes of a first major win similarly went up in the air.Augusta National/Getty ImagesMark Calcavecchia, Ryder Cup (1991)A traumatic meltdown with a happy ending, Calcavecchia was inconsolable after a collapse that he believed had cost his American team the 1991 Ryder Cup at Kiawah Island. Four up with four holes to play against Colin Montgomerie, the 1989 Open champion looked to be cruising to a crucial point, only to lose all four remaining holes as his Scottish opponent secured a vital half-point for Team Europe. A horrified Calcavecchia looked set to be the scapegoat of a bad-blooded tournament later dubbed \"The War on the Shore,\" but Germany's Bernhard Langer spared his blushes by missing his six-foot putt that would have retained the Cup for Europe, sealing a 14 ½ - 13 ½ win for the US.Augusta National/Getty ImagesGreg Norman, The Masters (1996)Nicknamed \"The Great White Shark,\" Norman saw defeat snatched from the jaws of victory at The Masters in 1996. Having led all three rounds and carrying a six-shot lead over Nick Faldo into the final round, the Australian still had a healthy four-stroke lead over the Englishman with 11 to play at Augusta. Faldo didn't even have to make a birdie to surge into a two-shot lead just four holes later, as Norman sunk with three straight bogeys and a double bogey. Norman bit back with two birdies over the next three holes, but his fate was sealed with another double bogey at the 16th, as Faldo cruised to his sixth major with a five-shot cushion.David Cannon/Allsport/Getty ImagesJean Van De Velde, British Open (1999)A meltdown in equal parts memorable and heart-breaking, Van De Velde's18th hole tailspinat the 1999 British Open is one of the most famous implosions in sporting history. Having arrived at Carnoustie in Scotland as the world No. 152, Van De Velde teed off for the last time with a three-shot cushion; even a double bogey would have been enough to crown him as only the second Frenchman to lift the famous Claret Jug. What followed was the golfing equivalent of an anxiety dream, as the 33-year-old skewed his drive, hit his second shot bouncing off a grandstand into the rough, and then watched in horror as his third effort plopped into the Barry Burn. Pictures of Van De Velde -- still smiling -- stood ankle de"

We’re family,” Twain said. “This is a genre of music with a rich history that raised and nurtured my own songwriting and performance and recording career from childhood. Currently, the industry standard does a real disservice to this.”Twain, who was presented the award by rapper Megan Thee Stallion, shouted out some of the diverse acts she is spotlighting on her “Queen of Me” tour this year, including Lily Rose, Lindsay Ell, Hailey Whitters, Mickey Guyton and others.“I will continue to do my best as a trailblazer,” Twain said. “Together, let’s ensure all our fellow artists get equal play regardless of gender, age or race.”She also performed acappella with the African American singing group, The BoykinZ, while presenting an award onstage. Twain connected with the group, who are sisters and rising country stars, after Kelly Clarkson surprised them recently by bringing Twain out to meet themduring an episode of Clarkson’s daytime talk show."

He was being starved to the point where he can be dead at any moment, and he suffers a great deal. He barely can't speak, he barely can move,\" David's brother Ilay said in an interview on Monday.In the video, Evyatar says: \"I haven't eaten for days... I barely got drinking water.\" He is seen digging what he says will be his own grave.OtherA still showing Israeli hostage Evyatar David being held in a Gaza tunnel from the video released by HamasHostages' families have urged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to prioritise their release as reports suggest he might be planning to expand the military campaign.The footage of Evyatar was released after Palestinian Islamic Jihad published video of another hostage, Rom Braslavski, thin and crying.Both men were abducted from the Nova music festival during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023.They are among 50 hostages still being held in Gaza, 20 of whom are believed to be alive.Ilay David said his father had barely recognised his son Evyatar's voice on the video and had not been able to sleep. He said his mother cried all day.\"Seeing those images of my brother as a human skeleton, we understood it's, it's, it's a new kind of cruelty,\" Mr David said. \"It's the lowest you can get.\"He called on world leaders to unite to save him and other hostages \"from the cruel, twisted hands of Hamas\".\"So we have to be so focused on delivering the message, which is, Evyatar is dying, we need to give him medicine, to give him food, proper food, and you need to get this treatment now, or else will die.\"Hamas's armed wing has denied it intentionally starves prisoners, saying hostages eat what their fighters and people in Gaza eat.Ilay DavidEvyatar David (L) with his brother Ilay shown here in happier timesHundreds of Israeli ex-officials appeal to Trump to help end Gaza warWorld leaders condemn videos of emaciated Israeli hostages in Gaza as Red Cross calls for accessFamine 'currently playing out' in Gaza, UN-backed experts warnAfter the hostages' videos were released, Netanyahu spoke with their families, telling them that efforts to return all the hostages \"will continue constantly and relentlessly\".But an Israeli official - widely quoted by local media - said Netanyahu was working to free the hostages through \"the military defeat of Hamas\".The possibility of a new escalation in Gaza may further anger Israel's allies who have been pushing for an immediate ceasefire as reports of Palestinians dying from starvation or malnutrition cause shock around the world.The main group supporting hostages' families condemned the idea of a new military offensive saying: \"Netanyahu is leading Israel and the hostages to doom.\"That view was pointedly made in a letter by some 600 retired Israeli security officials sent to US President Donald Trump urging him to pressure Israel to immediately end the war in Gaza.\"Your credibility with the vast majority of Israelis augments your ability to steer Prime Minister [Benjamin] Netanyahu and his government in the right direction: End the war, return the hostages, stop the suffering,\" they wrote.The group included former Mossad chief Tamir Pardo, Ami Ayalon, former chief of Shin Bet - Israel's domestic secret service agency - former Prime Minister Ehud Barak, and former Defence Minister Moshe Yaalon among others.\"It is our professional judgement that Hamas no longer poses a strategic threat to Israel,\" they said.\"At first this war was a just war, a defensive war, but when we achieved all military objectives, this war ceased to be a just war,\" said Ayalon.The former top leaders head the Commanders for Israel's Security (CIS) group, which has urged the government in the past to focus on securing the return of the hostages.\"Stop the Gaza War!

    "full_content": "UK-French small boats pilot plan comes into force2 hours agoShareSaveShareSaveEPAThe UK-French \"one-in, one-out\" pilot scheme, aimed at reducing the number of small boats crossing the Channel, has come into force with detentions of illegal migrants due to start within days.The deal will see some of those arriving in the UK in small boats detained and returned to France.In exchange the UK will accept from France an equal number of asylum seekers provided they have not already tried to make the crossing and can pass security and eligibility checks.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the plan was a \"product of months of grown-up diplomacy\" which would \"deliver real results\".But the Conservatives said it would \"make no difference whatsoever\".Sir Keir and French President Emmanuel Macron announced the agreement in July, but it was still subject to legal scrutiny by the European Commission and EU member states.The UK government has now said that the \"EU Commission, Germany and other member states have given the green light on this innovative approach\" meaning the scheme can go ahead.Under the plan, an adult migrant who tries to get to the UK by crossing the Channel could be returned to France if their claim for asylum is deemed to be inadmissible. Returns could begin to take place within weeks.UK and international law prevents the government from sending asylum seekers back to their country of origin before their claim has been considered and turned down. However, they can be sent to safe countries prepared to consider their claim.How many people cross the Channel in small boats?'One in, one out' sounds simple - but the migrant deal could be complicatedExtra 300 officers to tackle small boat people smugglingThe government has not confirmed how many migrants would be returned and accepted under the plan, but said it would look to \"ramp up both the pace and scale of returns over the course of the pilot scheme\".There have been reports that 50 people per week could be returned, compared to the weekly average of more than 800 people currently making the crossing.Sir Keir has previously said the pilot is not \"a silver bullet\" but believes it will deter people from making the dangerous journey following a big increase in the numbers so far this year.As of 30 July, more than 25,000 people had crossed the Channel in small boats in 2025 - around 49% higher than at the same point in 2024.The government is under pressure to reduce the numbers, having previously promised to \"smash the gangs\" organising the journeys.Home Secretary Yvette Cooper hailed the agreement as \"ground breaking\" and an \"important step towards undermining the business model of the organised crime gangs\".\"It is also right to make clear that – while the UK will always be ready to play its part alongside other countries in helping those fleeing persecution and conflict – this must be done in a controlled and managed legal way, not through dangerous, illegal, and uncontrolled routes,\" she said.On Monday, the government announced £100m to fund 300 National Crime Agency Officers to stop the people smugglers arranging the crossings.It has also said it wants to tackle illegal working, to reduce pull factors encouraging people to come to the UK.Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp said the government's deal with the French would be less effective than the Rwanda plan, proposed by the previous Conservative government.\"The Rwanda removals deterrent, under which 100% of illegal arrivals would be removed, was ready to go last summer but Labour cancelled it just days before it was due to start with no proper replacement plan,\" he said.\"As a result, this year so far has been the worst ever for illegal immigrants crossing the Channel.\"When the UK and France first announced the plan in July, the charity Asylum Matters criticised the measure, arguing: \"The only way to stop people from making dangerous journeys is to give them real safe routes to seek sanctuary.\"Migration"

Planes, trains and ferries were cancelled amid warnings of a \"threat to life\".Network Rail Scotland said it was working to remove debris and trees from routes following the \"unprecedented\" storm.Anamber warningwas place to 23:00 BST for most of Scotland, as well as a yellow warning that also covers northern England, north Wales and Northern Ireland.Storm Floris is the sixth named storm of the 2024/25 season and the first since January.Wick in the Highlands saw winds of 82mph, the strongest gusts recorded since Storm Floris struck on Monday.Some mountain locations saw wind gusts over 100mph, but meteorologists focus on sites where very strong gusts are less usual and likely to have more impact.There were reports of trees and campervans toppling over in the hardest hit areas.Events including the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo and shows at Fringe by the Sea in North Berwick were also cancelled.The yellow warning will remain in place for the Northern Isles off the north coast of Scotland until 08:00 on Tuesday, and 23:59 on Monday for all other areas.On Tuesday the weather will be less windy but still blustery with showers across northern and central areas.Follow updates: Storm Floris bringing 'unseasonably strong' winds to parts of the UKAmber weather warnings in place for most of Scotland as Storm Floris sweeps inHow do storms like Floris get their names?Why does it always rain in the school summer holidays?Passengers in Scotland have been warned disruption to the rail network is likely to continue into Tuesday.Ross Moran, Network Rail Scotland's route director, said: \"Our teams have been working tirelessly to keep services moving where possible and to clear fallen trees and debris from the tracks.\"Our teams will work through the night, but this work will continue into Tuesday morning.\"It comes after Lnerwarned passengers not to travel north of Newcastle on Monday. Customers with tickets can use them until Wednesday.Scottish ferry operator CalMac issued a series of cancellation warnings and warned of disruption across its network.Most of Scotland's major road bridges closed to high-sided vehicles and motorists were urged to slow down in poor weather and avoid exposed Highland and coastal routes.Several shows at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival were cancelled as a \"precautionary\" measure, and flights were cancelled in Northern Ireland due to the storm.Meanwhile, postal services were affected by Floris meaning that some students in Scotland will have to wait until Tuesday to receive their SQA exam results.Strong winds hit the coastal town of Largs in North AyrshireAngela Constance, the Scottish secretary for home affairs, encouraged people to check on elderly or vulnerable neighbours during the storm, and warned those travelling on Monday to view it as \"a winter journey\" and take warm clothes.Jim Dale, a meteorologist and founder of independent forecaster British Weather Services, warned those in areas affected by the warnings: \"If you are venturing out, keep away from the forest, keep away from the woods, keep off the coastal plain.\"Named storms in August are not that rare, with five taking place since 2020.Last year, Storm Lilian struck the UK on 23 August just before the bank holiday weekend, closing stages at the Leeds Festival and cancelling Heathrow flights.Storms Antoni and Betty brought disruption in 2023, while stormsEllenandFrancisin 2020 were described as \"two of the most notable August storms in the last 50 years\" by the Met Office.These two storms brought wind gusts of 79mph and 81mph respectively with transport disruption, coastal flooding and power cuts.The storm follows the UK's fifth warmest July on record, according to provisional figures from the Met Office.All four UK nations recorded one of their 10 warmest Julys, and July was the sixth consecutive month of above-average mean temperatures for the UK, the Met Office said.The first day of the month brought the highest temperature of the year so far, with 35.8C in Faversham, Kent."

There's currently no specified time limit for being prescribed the drug.Both drugs help reduce appetite and can lead to life-changing weight loss. They are prescribed alongside programmes that support healthy weight loss through changes to diet and physical activity.In aWegovy drug trial, patients regained around two-thirds of their original weight once they came off the injections. It's a similar story for those onMounjaro.New advice from NICE, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, encourages patients to build long-term behavioural habits, use self-monitoring tools, and draw on wider support \"from online communities to family-led interventions and local activities.\"Prof Jonathan Benger from NICE said: \"Successful weight management doesn't end when medication stops or when someone completes a behavioural programme.\"We know that the transition period after treatment is crucial, and people need structured support to maintain the positive changes they've made.\"Prof Kamila Hawthorn from the Royal College of GPs said: \"There is no one-size fits all approach to tackling obesity - what works for one patient will likely not work for another.\"We also need to see a greater focus on prevention, stopping people becoming overweight in the first place so they don't require a medical intervention later.\"Obesity can cause people difficulties in their daily lives, and put them at more risk of serious health problems, such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and some types of cancer.Weight lossObesityHealthNHS"

I just cried and cried.\"Victims' bodies \"melted away so only their eyes were visible\", Ms Lee says, as a blast equivalent to 15,000 tons of TNT enveloped a city of 420,000 people. What remained in the aftermath were corpses too mangled to be identified.\"The atomic bomb… it's such a terrifying weapon.\"It's been 80 years since the United States detonated 'Little Boy', humanity's first-ever atomic bomb, over the centre of Hiroshima, instantly killing some 70,000 people. Tens of thousands more would die in the coming months from radiation sickness, burns and dehydration.The devastation wrought by the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki – which brought a decisive end to both World War Two and Japanese imperial rule across large swaths of Asia – has been well-documented over the past eight decades.Less well-known is the fact that about 20% of the immediate victims were Koreans.Korea had been a Japanese colony for 35 years when the bomb was dropped. An estimated 140,000 Koreans were living in Hiroshima at the time - many having moved there due to forced labour mobilisation, or to survive under colonial exploitation.Those who survived the atom bomb, along with their descendants, continue to live in the long shadow of that day – wrestling with disfigurement, pain, and a decades-long fight for justice that remains unresolved.Getty ImagesHapcheon has been dubbed \"Korea's Hiroshima\" due to the number of nuclear bomb survivors who lived there after the war\"No-one takes responsibility,\" says Shim Jin-tae, an 83-year-old survivor. \"Not the country that dropped the bomb. Not the country that failed to protect us. America never apologised. Japan pretends not to know. Korea is no better. They just pass the blame - and we're left alone.\"Mr Shim now lives in Hapcheon, South Korea: a small county which, having become the home of dozens of survivors like he and Ms Lee, has been dubbed \"Korea's Hiroshima\".For Ms Lee, the shock of that day has not faded  - it etched itself into her body as illness. She now lives with skin cancer, Parkinson's disease, and angina, a condition stemming from poor blood flow to the heart, which typically manifests as chest pain.But what weighs more heavily is that the pain didn't stop with her. Her son Ho-chang, who supports her, was diagnosed with kidney failure and is undergoing dialysis while awaiting a transplant.\"I believe it's due to radiation exposure, but who can prove it?\" Ho-chang Lee says. \"It's hard to verify scientifically - you'd need genetic testing, which is exhausting and expensive.The Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) told the BBC that it had gathered genetic data between 2020 and 2024 and would continue further studies until 2029. It would \"consider expanding the definition of victims\" to second- and- third-generation survivors only \"if the results are statistically significant\", it said.The Korean tollOf the 140,000 Koreans in Hiroshima at the time of the bombing, many were from Hapcheon.Surrounded by mountains with little farmland, it was a difficult place to live. Crops were seized by the Japanese occupiers, droughts ravaged the land, and thousands of people left the rural country for Japan during the war. Some were forcibly conscripted; others were lured by the promise that \"you could eat three meals a day and send your kids to school.\"But in Japan, Koreans were second-class citizens – often given the hardest, dirtiest and most dangerous jobs. Mr Shim says his father worked in a munitions factory as a forced labourer, while his mother hammered nails into wooden ammunition crates.In the aftermath of the bomb, this distribution of labour translated into dangerous and often fatal work for Koreans in Hiroshima.BBC/Hyojung KimFor Shim Jin-tae, it's not just about being compensated – it's about being acknowledged\"Korean workers had to clean up the dead,\" Mr Shim, who is the director of the Hapcheon branch of the Korean Atomic Bomb Victims Association, tells BBC Korean. \"At first they used stretchers, but there were too many bodies. Eventually, they used dustpans to gather corpses and burned them in schoolyards.\"\"It was mostly Koreans who did this. Most of the post-war clean-up and munitions work was done by us.\"According to a study by the Gyeonggi Welfare Foundation, some survivors w"

It has become an important export market for Moscow after several European countries cut trade when Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.Trump did not specify what the new tariff would be, but it comes just days after he unveiled a hefty 25% levy on India.Delhi called Trump's warning \"unjustified and unreasonable\".In a statement, a spokesman for India's foreign ministry, Randhir Jaiswal, said the US had encouraged India to import Russian gas at the start of the conflict, \"for strengthening global energy markets stability\".He said India \"began importing from Russia because traditional supplies were diverted to Europe after the outbreak of the conflict\".India also criticised the US - its largest trading partner - for introducing the tariffs, when the US itself is still doing trade with Russia. Last year,the US traded goodsworth an estimated $3.5bn (£2.6bn) with Russia, despite tough sanctions and tariffs.\"Like any major economy, India will take all necessary measures to safeguard its national interests and economic security,\" the foreign ministry statement said.Last week, Trump had described India as a \"friend\" but said its tariffs on US products \"are far too high\" and he warned of an unspecified \"penalty\" over its trade with Russia.His latest Truth Social post again struck a critical tone.\"India is not only buying massive amounts of Russian Oil, they are then, for much of the Oil purchased, selling it on the Open Market for big profits,\" he wrote.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not ordered India's oil refineries to stop buying Russian oil, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the situation.Ajay Srivastava, a former Indian trade official and head of the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), a Delhi-based think tank, said Trump's claims about India's oil trade with Russia are misleading for several reasons.He told the BBC that the trade has been transparent and broadly understood by the US.Mr Srivastava said India ramped up purchases of oil to help stabilise global markets after Western sanctions disrupted supplies - helping to stop a global oil price shock.He also said that India's oil refineries - both public and private - decide where to buy crude oil based on factors like price, supply security, and export rules. They operate independently of the government and do not need its approval to buy from Russia or other countries.I'm 'disappointed but not done' with Putin, Trump tells BBCThough relations between the US and Russia warmed after Trump returned to the White house in January, the US president has more recently toughened his rhetoric against the Kremlin and Russian President Vladimir Putin.Trump has questioned whether Putin is truly committed to peace with Ukraine. In Monday's Truth Social post he used stern language, describing the Russian military as the \"Russian War Machine\".Russia's leader has repeatedly said he is ready for peace but only if Kyiv meets certain conditions, such as recognising Ukrainian territories that Russia has occupied.Trump has threatened Moscow with severe tariffs targeting its oil and other exports if a ceasefire with Ukraine is not agreed by 8 August.US envoy Steve Witkoff is due to visit Russia later this week, where he is expected to meet Putin.Additional reporting by Soutik BiswasTrump to hit India with 25% tariffs - plus 'penalty' for trade with RussiaKremlin plays down Trump's nuclear rhetoric as US envoy set to visit MoscowTrump tariffs on Asia: Which economies were hit hardest?Trump tariffsNarendra ModiIndiaDonald TrumpUnited States"

Earlier in the series, Toni chose to couple with one of the other boys, Harrison, rather than Cach.After the re-coupling, Cach cried and was consoled by friend and fellow Islander Ty, something Georgia says was a key moment in the series.\"I think where the season was going, almost questioning how genuine a lot of the couples were, it was really nice to see raw emotion coming from someone who was feeling real feelings,\" she says.\"Especially it coming from a man, because I think we just don't see that enough. We don't see men showing their raw emotion.\"I think it's one of those things that should be celebrated.\"Harriet agreed, adding: \"It was really moving to see someone so in touch with their emotions and really let it out.\"It's actually really powerful to see him own it, and encourage other men to be in touch with their emotions.\"Couple Dejon Noel-Williams and Meg Moore narrowly missed out on the final after they were dramatically dumped during Sunday's Episode.Former Islanders returned to the villa and voted them the least compatible remaining couple.Love Island's popularity has risen this year, thanks to the success of the US version of the showand a jump in social media interest.ITV said this series was on track to be the biggest since Series 9 in January 2023.It said streams on subscription service ITVX were up 9% year on year, and figures from TikTok show 1 million people have followed Love Island's official account this year.Earlier on Monday, ITV bosses announced Love Island All Stars - where previous fan-favourite islanders return to the villa - would get a third series.They said it would air early next year and take place over six weeks in South Africa.Listen to Newsbeatliveat 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen backhere.ITVTelevisionReality TVLove Island"

A number of spy novels followed.While guest editing the Today programme in 2007, she said spy writers had created \"a totally glamorous world around the profession of spying\" that \"bears very little relation to reality\".In 2014 she revealed on BBC Breakfast that her novels had to be submitted to the security service for clearance, and that she had occasionally been asked to change names and places by MI5.'My novels are cleared by MI5'MI5Spying"

But while Hodgkinson-Hedgecox told Panorama her actions had been impulsive and she regretted them, another was unapologetic - defending his online calls to sink small boats and refusing to condemn rioters who set fire to the hotel where he was protesting.Hodgkinson-Hedgecox, 38, is wearing an electronic tag around her ankle at the house she shares with her partner Charlotte and their two children. Sentenced to two years and three months in jail after pleading guilty to violent disorder, but now released on licence, she cannot leave the house between 19:00 and 07:00.\"It was really exciting,'' she says. \"The adrenaline was just… it was crazy. It was a real eye-opener that I would never do again.\"With her distinctive short cropped hair, Hodgkinson-Hedgecox is easily identifiable in the reams of footage from that evening outside the hotel. She did not throw any missiles, she had no part in setting any fires, but she was standing in front of police lines shouting abuse at them, and making obscene gestures at the asylum seekers living in the hotel.Cameras captured Hodgkinson-Hedgecox making obscene gestures at the asylum seekers in the hotelBrady, now 12, had seen the protests on TikTok and repeatedly asked Hodgkinson-Hedgecox to take him there. She agreed.She says she went there because she believed social media posts which said asylum seekers had been filming young girls at a park close to the hotel, near the centre of Tamworth. But Hodgkinson-Hedgecox acknowledges the claims may not have been true.\"I did swear. I was just shouting to the police, like, how would you like it if your child has been videoed by them? There's a level where you should be sticking up for us as well as them,\" she says.\"I was frustrated, I was really frustrated. Everybody's got an opinion on what's going on right now.\"The former factory worker, with Brady at her side, stayed there as the violence escalated.\"When they started smashing the windows, they were throwing fireworks through the holes and they were going bang in the building, I thought, something bad's going to happen here,\" she says.\"As soon as I seen the lighter go on that petrol bomb I thought, oh my God, this building's going to go down. I was really concerned for [the people inside]. I thought, wow, this is gonna go up in flames, gonna kill them all. And it's not right, it's wrong. It's so wrong.\"Hodgkinson-Hedgecox has been jailed several times. Until the riots, her last conviction, for battery, was in 2009. She says she has turned her life around since and is totally focused on her family.EPITOGFireworks were set off among the crowds of protestors in Tamworth\"I accept that I was wrong for being there. I should never have been there. And I accept I should have never took a child with me either,\" she says. \"Massive regret, huge regret. It's bad parenting.\"Patriotic Alternative, a far-right, anti-immigration group run by former BNP activist Mark Collett contacted Hodgkinson-Hedgecox's partner Charlotte after she was jailed.It offered her £1,000, saying it was providing financial support to the families of some of those convicted for their role in the rioting, describing them as political prisoners. Charlotte, who told us she was in a bad place after her partner was convicted, says she now regrets accepting the money.In Rotherham, Ross Hart took part in a protest outside another asylum hotel. The 30-year-old says he was angry about the number of people arriving in the UK in small boats.Ross Hart pleaded guilty "

With the help of Ed Sheeran, he learns to play a musical instrument for the first time and inspired by his children's carefree risk-taking, he climbs a 600-foot Alpine dam.National GeographicHemsworth joined Ed Sheeran on stage in Romania last year after learning to play the drums\"Being thrust into unfamiliar environments where you're facing adversity or risk helps you understand how fragile life is and how quickly it can change,\" he says.Hemsworth, whose brothers, Liam and Luke, are also famous actors, says he now takes nothing for granted and has learnt to not \"settle for the easy route as the greatest lessons come from the more challenging times\".One of the biggest challenges for the actor was in the first season of the National Geographic series when a genetic test revealed he carries two copies of the gene ApoE4, one from his mother and one from his father, making him between eight and 10 times more likely to develop Alzheimer's than those without both copies of the gene.\"That warning sign was further motivation to take care of myself,\" Hemsworth explains.\"It also felt like a great opportunity to offer up education and a better understanding for people navigating it as Alzheimer's is something a lot of people face.\"Watch: Chris Hemsworth on Limitless' return and his increased risk of Alzheimer'sWhile Hemsworth has become increasingly interested in how to live better, he says there's a fine line between healthy aging and extreme biohacking.Biohackers want to make their bodies and brains function better by \"hacking\" their biology.\"You want to live a longer and better life but at what cost? You could have your exact routine but there's no point doing all of that if you're isolated and lonely at home,\" says Hemsworth.\"I'm going to put energy into health and wellness but I also want to enjoy life.\"This mindset puts him at odds with more extreme elements of the biohacking movement, which has gained attention through figures like tech entrepreneur Bryan Johnson.Getty ImagesBryan Johnson's Project Blueprint is a controversial plan to reverse ageing and live foreverJohnson, 47, has spent millions of dollars in a bid to slow down aging - his regime, Project Blueprint, has seen him take numerous supplements a day, follow a strict diet and sleep routine and undergo a plasma exchange.It's an approach that Hemsworth finds intriguing but admits he has \"no interest to explore\".\"I like dancing in and out of those spaces,\" Hemsworth explains. \"Sometimes I try one thing, then another, and different pieces of science resonate at different times in your life.\"If you're too boxed in with one way of thinking, you close the doors to other opportunities.\"As well as reversing his biological age, Johnson also wants to crack the code on how to live forever.But the Marvel star says no one has figured out how to cheat death yet and he doesn't think anyone will so \"we have to embrace death\".\"Suffering comes from denial of our inevitability of death - we all have an expiration death.\"Getty ImagesHemsworth lives in Australia with his three childrenHe adds: \"If you were told you had 200 years guaranteed you'd become more complacent and reckless. The idea that life can be taken away at any second is a beautiful reminder to appreciate every moment.\"He also explains that if humans could live forever then relationships with other people wouldn't be as important, and for Hemsworth, family appears to really matter.The Thor actor lives in Byron Bay with his wife, actress Elsa Pataky, and their three children. Limitless touches on how his choices affect not just his own life, but those around him.Part of what spurred him on to film a second series was \"the great feedback from young kids, parents and grandparents\" and realising that he was able to inspire others"

    "full_content": "Could I get car finance compensation?9 hours agoShareSaveLucy HookerBusiness reporter, BBC NewsShareSaveGetty ImagesIf you used car finance to buy a vehicle any time in the last 18 years, you could be in line for compensation.It follows a recent court ruling on hidden commissions that lenders paid to dealers, which opens the door for potential payouts to millions, if they are found to have been mis-sold finance.If you are eligible, you are still in for a bit of a wait, and for now the advice is not to sign up with a claims company promising to help you get redress, because it won't speed things up and they will charge a fee.But there are a few other things to bear in mind, if you are trying to work out whether you are likely to get compensation.Am I eligible?Most car buyers use motor finance, borrowing money and paying ininstalments over time.Car dealers almost always receive a payment for their part in arranging the loan - a commission.A Supreme Court ruled that many of these commission payments were legal, but in certain circumstances the failure by dealers to properly disclose details of the charges could be unfair and therefore unlawful.The ruling narrowed the scope of redress set by lower courts, which would have allowed claims for compensation from many more car buyers.The key is whether customers were treated \"fairly\", although the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), is still working on exactly what that will mean.One specific group of buyers who are likely to be eligible are people who took out car loans that included discretionary commission arrangements (DCAs). They were banned in 2021 but prior to that lenders gave car dealers leeway to charge higher interest and earn a percentage of that as commission. Customers who had DCAs and were overcharged as a result are likely to have a claim.If you still have your contract you can check the terms and conditions.How much is too much?The Supreme Court ruled in a test case that one car buyer, Marcus Johnson, should be entitled to compensation, setting a reference point for future cases.Mr Johnson told the court he was presented with \"an enormous amount of paperwork\". He didn't read it all and signed, trusting the sales representative to talk him through the deal.But 55% of the interest he was paying on the car was commission, which the judge deemed unreasonable.Anyone paying commission at that level is likely to be eligible for compensation, but it remains to be seen how much lower rates would have to be, to count as fair, ruling a customer out of the right to compensation.Car finance judgement 'a hard pill to swallow'Car finance payouts have been limited, but lenders aren't off the hookThe judge also referred to Mr Johnson's lack of \"sophistication\" when it came to financial matters. He was a young driver, with little experience.Most of us feel a bit bamboozled by a car showroom, with the hard-sell tactics and unfamiliar jargon, points out Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell.\"It feels incredibly pressured,\" she says. And most people don't fully understand the deal they are signing up to, which often include \"balloon payments\", backloading the payment at the end of the contract.\"For a lot of people it will feel unfair,\" she says. But just because you would like to claw back some of the money you've paid, doesn't mean you will get anything.What about the small print?Part of the debate around whether car buyers should be compensated revolves around whether customers had given \"informed consent\" for commission payments.The details of any financial arrangement including commission must be included in the terms and conditions. But many people do not read the T&Cs, especially if there is time pressure, and someone is dangling a set of brand new car keys in front of them.Mr Johnson admitted he hadn't.But the Supreme Court ruled that the key elements of the contract were not given enough prominence.So even if all the details - including commission arrangements - were there in your contract, if they weren't highlighted in a separate box or in bold, you might be eligible for compensation, says Alex Neill, co-founder of charity Consumer Voice.If I think I am eligible, what do I do?The FCA is setting up a compensation scheme. In October it will launch a six week consultation over how it should work, with the first payments expected to come in 2026.So you can just wait until the scheme is available.Alternatively,the FCA suggestswriting to your lenderto establish the facts of your own case.Lenders must acknowledge your complaint within eight weeks, and by submitting a complaint at this stage you may get an indication of how likely you are to receive any redress, says Ms Neill.If you cannot remember the name of the lender involved the car dealership should be able to help you, she says.Consumer groups and the FCA advise against signing up with a claims company. Many are advertising their services online, but they cannot proceed with a claim "

They cannot be named for legal reasons.They had previously admitted killing the cats, which were found cut open and strung up. Knives, blowtorches and scissors were also found at the scene.It is understood that police are now looking into possible links to a wider network of cat torturers who film, post and sell footage of attacks on encrypted messaging apps.Much of the content uncovered by the BBC is too graphic to showThese groups started in China, but BBC News has identified members now active across the world, including in the UK.The scale of the network has been documented by animal rights activists Feline Guardians.The group says between May 2023 and May 2024, a new video showing the torture and execution of a kitten or cat was uploaded approximately every 14 hours.It says it has documented 24 groups active this year, the largest of which had more than 1,000 members. The most active torturer is believed to have filmed the torture and killing of more than 200 cats.Chat conversations in one group, seen by the BBC, include what appear to be UK-based accounts discussing how to get hold of cats to abuse.One member discussed how to adopt kittens from the RSPCA and posted application forms. Another post shared an advert for kittens for sale in the UK, posting that they wanted to \"torture them so bad\".Lara is a volunteer with Feline Guardians. We have agreed not to use her full name for fear of reprisals.She said: \"Every day I feel heartbroken, there is not a day that goes past that I don't feel like my heart is breaking.\"She has spent time undercover in the forums and says there is no limit to the pain the torturers are prepared to inflict.She describes it as the \"depths of evil\".Lara, from Feline Guardians, says she was shocked by the \"horrific\" content she found onlineVideos and photographs seen by the BBC are graphic and extremely disturbing.They include footage of cats being drowned and electrocuted. One video speculates on how long a kitten in a cage will survive if it is not given food.Group members appear to want to inflict as much pain as possible. In online chats, torturers explain how they use electrocution to resuscitate a cat in order to prolong suffering.New members are encouraged to mutilate and post videos to gain access to a wider network.The BBC saw evidence that suggested children were taking part in these groups. One member posted: \"I'm 10 years old and I like to torture cats.\"In September 2023, the network even promoted a \"100 cat kill\" competition, during which members were encouraged to see how quickly the group could torture and kill 100 cats.Activists from Feline Guardians say they've uncovered 24 online groups active this year, each posting hundreds of images and videos of abuseVideos depicting the horrific torture of cats first went viral in China in 2023.The man responsible for two extremely graphic videos, Wang Chaoyi, was detained for 15 days by the Chinese authorities and forced to issue a \"letter of repentance\".But his footage developed a cult following and others began making similar content for Chinese and Western social media, gaining thousands of views, before groups developed on encrypted messaging apps.One website even describes itself as a place for the \"cat-lover community\" and requests viewers \"submit your work\".Users can only gain access if they provide evidence of their own cat torture.Who is Little Winnie?\"Little Winnie\" is a well known name used in the cat torture community for having a profile picture that mocks the Chinese leader Xi Jinping with an image of Winnie the Pooh.Accounts with that name and profile picture are described as administrators in a number of forums.Little Winnie is the name given to the administrator of many of the cat torture groupsAn activist from Feline Guardians got in touch with one of those Little Winnie accounts and lured the man behind it into an online relationship.\"I felt disgusted having to be friendly and then having to have this friendship with him,\" the activist, who does not"

For police up to central government, we should always be as transparent as possible when it comes to cases.\"He added: \"This is clearly a deeply upsetting and distressing case which the public are right to feel shocked and angry about.\"In relation to this case, the individuals have been charged and we are now in a live investigation.\"In a statement, Warwickshire Police and Crime Commissioner Philip Seccombe said: \"It is essential to state that policing decisions - such as whether to release details about a suspect - must follow national guidan"

One of his sons, Flávio, who is a senator, briefly put his father on speakerphone to the crowd in Rio de Janeiro.Flávio also reportedly later published a video, which he deleted afterwards, of his father on the other side of the call sending a message to supporters.Mr Moraes also banned him from receiving visits, except from lawyers or people authorised by the Supreme Court, and from using a mobile phone directly or through third parties.He had already, previously, been ordered to wear an ankle tag, to adhere to a curfew, to not use social media, and to not contact his son Eduardo Bolsonaro who has lobbied US officials on his behalf in the US.These restrictions were imposed because of allegations he was encouraging Donald Trump to interfere in the case.Brazilian Supreme Court justice threatens to arrest BolsonaroWhy Trump's tariffs on Brazil are more about political retaliation than tradeCourt orders Bolsonaro to wear ankle tag and puts him under curfewJair BolsonaroBrazil"

    "full_content": "Radio personality James Whale dies aged 749 hours agoShareSaveShareSaveGetty ImagesJames Whale appeared on Celebrity Big Brother in 2016Broadcaster and radio personality James Whale has died aged 74 following a  cancer diagnosis, his agent confirmed on Monday.His career spanned six decades, including stints on the BBC airwaves as well as stations such as LBC and TalkSport.His wife Nadine Lamont-Brown said in a statement: \"It is with deep sadness that I announce the passing of my darling husband, James Whale, who died peacefully this morning with a smile on his face, holding my hand.\"Known for being outspoken and often controversial, more recently Whale went on to front his own podcast and night-time weekly radio show on TalkRadio.Whale's TalkTV colleague and friend Mike Graham read an obituary on air and paid tribute to Whale, who had stage four kidney cancer.Graham also posted on X:\"What a remarkable man. What an extraordinary talent. What an incredible voice. The world is a lesser place today…RIP James.\"TalkTV's official X account described Whale as \"a broadcasting legend for over 50 years\", who would \"be missed by so many\" at the network.On the same platform, fellow broadcaster Piers Morgan called him \"one of Britain's all-time great radio talk show hosts and a fantastic bloke.\"Fame - and infamyWhale was first diagnosed with kidney cancer in 2000 and then, in 2020,he revealed it had returned.In recent months, he had documented his deteriorating health on social media, his Talk TV programme and his podcast Tales of the Whales.He first gained prominence in the 1980s as the host of The James Whale Radio Show on Radio Aire in Leeds, before hosting a night-time radio show on TalkSport in the late mid-late 90s.When TV stations first started airing programmes after midnight in the late 1980s, one presenter seized the opportunity to gain fame - and infamy - with a type of live late-night show that hadn't been seen on British screens before.On the James Whale Radio Show, the presenter was a cross between a shock jock, talk show host, gonzo roving reporter and working men's club MC.Launched in 1988, Whale's live, often chaotic programme was like a daytime TV format gone rogue: one which had lost its inhibitions and any qualms about upholding the usual standards of taste and decency.Some said it had completely lost its morals. But many viewers loved it.Whale took calls from - and unceremoniously cut off - callers. He sparred with celebrities and expert guests, dallied with scantily-clad \"bimbos\", and offered combative, sardonic or flippant takes on topical issues, from immigration to teenage gambling to sex therapy.In short, it entertained and offended in equal measure.The James Whale Radio Show had \"Radio\" in its title because it went out live from Leeds on both Radio Aire and ITV simultaneously at 1am on a Friday night, as people sat at home after coming back from the pub.ITV/ShutterstockThe James Whale Radio Show ran on ITV (and on the radio) from 1988-92'Mighty Mouth'At first, it only went out in Yorkshire and the north-west, but was soon picked up elsewhere as ratings went up and other ITV regional counterparts floundered.When it arrived on London Weekend Television in April 1989, the press started to take notice.A review in The Stage newspaper noted how \"Mighty Mouth\" Whale had taken a \"critical hammering\" since transferring across the ITV network.But it added that, because it was broadcast so long after any family audience had gone to bed, it was pointless to complain about the show's \"crudities, ruderies, or the occasional swear word\".In fact, the reviewer found Whale \"the liveliest natural new personality to turn up on TV for ages\", saying he possessed \"a surfeit of punch and charisma\".Getty ImagesWhale on Metro Radio in Newcastle in the 1970sThe smooth-voiced Whale, from Surrey, had been presenting on Radio Aire since 1982, after cutting his teeth on stations in Middlesbrough, Derby and Newcastle.On Newcastle's Metro Radio from 1973-80, he set the template for phone-ins that gave callers short shrift.Before that, Whale's first proper job in broadcasting had been to found a radio station inside Top Shop at London's Oxford Circus in 1970 - the country's first in-store station.The 70s and 80s were the ages of larger-than-life radio DJs, and Whale's stint at Radio Aire saw him named local DJ of the year at the Sony Radio Awards in 1988.Moving to the small screen that year, he gained a national reputation, for better or for worse.'Filth and degradation'As one sketch duo who appeared on The James Whale Radio Show half-joked, the programme was known for its \"controversy, filth and degradation - and that's just behind the scenes\".It featured regular appearances from comics like Bernard Manning, Steve Coogan and Charlie Chuck, while Whale threw singers Wayne Hussey and Lemmy off for turning up drunk.The host even stormed off his own show once, frustrated with things going wrong behind the scenes.

It is used by media and spectators alike.In the hours after thesensational fifth Test between England and Indiaended, with the ground emptying, on that staircase was found a left shoe, then some underwear, then a right shoe.Because of their size, they presumably belonged to a man. Quite how the owners misplaced them, or when they realised their loss, is unclear. However, it raises the prospect that someone left this famous old ground both shoeless and pantless.It would have been entirely in keeping with the mayhem that had already played out on Monday morning.There had been 57 minutes of the most intense, dramatic and emotional sport you could ever wish to see.Twenty-five days of gripping Test cricket came down to a one-armed man painfully scampering 22 yards of south London turf. One wonders how the productivity of the UK was affected at the beginning of the working week, or how many offices in Mumbai, Kolkata and Bengaluru closed early.There had been an element of farce to the previous evening. Players went to the dressing rooms because of rain and bad light when the game was on a knife-edge, then stayed there as the gloom turned to evening sunshine.Any frustration over the events of Sunday turned into anticipation of what might be possible on Monday. Thirty-five runs or four wickets. The Oval was sold out, but would anyone bother to turn up?Turn up they did, filling this historic venue with constant noise and nervous energy. There were echoes of the2005 Ashes classic in Birmingham, when Edgbaston was full for what might have only been two deliveries of action. Just like then, there was a rich reward for turning up. India's six-run win here is the narrowest of its kind in this country since England beat Australia by two runs 20 years ago.England-India Test series best since 2005 Ashes - AgnewPublished10 hours agoWho pressed their Ashes case? Who disappointed? England's player ratingsPublished7 hours agoIndia win all-time classic despite Woakes heroicsPublished11 hours agoIndia began the day with a huddle that seemed to have every member of the touring party included. Security, chef, bus driver. England, naturally, played football.Fittingly, it was Surrey v England. When Jamie Overton took fours off each of the first two balls of the day, England had almost a quarter of the runs they required. It was the best it got.Jamie Smith has looked increasingly frazzled in his first five-Test series as a wicketkeeper. He wafted at two deliveries, then edged the third. The dhol drum of the Bharat Army beat out the rhythm of We Will Rock You, and rocked England were. When Overton was struck on the pad, umpire Kumar Dharmasena paid his own 2005 tribute with the slow finger of Rudi Koertzen.Josh Tongue had a scattergun game with the ball and found himself as the last line of defence before the stricken Chris Woakes.On Sunday evening, Woakes somehow folded his dislocated shoulder into a set of cricket whites, which sounds excruciatingly painful in itself. When Tongue had his stumps rearranged by Prasidh Krishna, security staff rushed on to the outfield, believing the match to be over. They had not been briefed that Woakes, the nicest man in cricket, is also the bravest.To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption,'Here he comes!' - Woakes comes out to bat with arm in slingEarlier this year, Woakes had a tattoo inked on his left tricep in memory of his late father Roger, who died last year. Now the same arm was strapped under his England sweater as he descended the pavilion stairs, putting his broken body on the line for the Three Lions on his chest.History will remember Woakes as a World Cup winner in both formats, an Ashes winner and one of the finest seamers in English conditions. This will trump them all. The Wizard will always be the man who tried to help England win a Test with only one functioning arm.How painful it must have been for Woakes to run three times between the wickets, his shoulder jolted by every step. Mercifully, he never faced a delivery. While Woakesplayed Jack Leach, Gus Atkinson could not ape Ben Stokes. Atkinson was bowled attempting to hit the six that would have levelled the scores and won the series.According to Stokes, Woakes' reaction in the dressing room was to \"shrug his shoulder\", which is probably the last thing he should have done.To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption,'England panicked' - Vaughan on fifth Te"

Also discovered at the scene were blowtorches, three knives and a pair of scissors.One kitten was found hanging from a rope and was completely ripped open, with its eyes bulging, the court heard.Alongside the tools, a significant amount of blood and fur were found.The teenagers also admitted one count of unlawful possession of a knife.Met PoliceThe pair were seen running away from the scene at the time - the Met Police originally issued this image which has been edited to protect the teenagers' identitySentencing the boy, Judge Rai told him his actions had been \"extensively planned\" and were \"clearly premeditated\".She told him: \"You said sorry in your [police] interview but reports also show that you struggle to show empathy and realise that the kittens would suffer.\"She added: \"It seems you chose the kittens because they have emotion and you would have power over them.\"Notes on the boy's phone detailed his desire to kill another person.They read: \"I really wanted to murder someone.\"Every day I was researching how to get away with murder. I have come close. I have killed cats to reduce my urges. I have skinned, strangled and stabbed cats.\"The boy, who may have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism which has yet to be diagnosed, had no previous convictions.AlamyThe kittens were found near Ruislip Golf CourseJudge Rai told the girl, who also had no previous convictions: \"It is not clear who took the lead but from what I have read you were both equally responsible.\"The court heard there were sinister items on the girl's mobile phone of mutilated pets and she had a fascination with dead human bodies.The judge told the girl she had \"the potential for a bright future which makes this case shocking and extremely concerning\".The girl had accepted she had been \"cold and cruel\" in her actions but this came after she had \"distanced\" herself from the offences.The judge added: \"It was clearly premediated and there was evidence you may have been the instigator and more willing to cause the kittens suffering for attention from the mental health agencies.\"The girl had placed messages on Gumtree to buy three kittens because \"she did not want them to be lonely\", the court heard.The court also ordered that the girl's pet rabbit be taken away from her.Det Con Rebecca Rickhuss, who led the investigation, said: \"This was a deeply distressing case and as we continued to gather evidence, we grew concerned that torturing and killing cats would be a catalyst onto further violent offending.\"I urge parents and carers to take an active interest in what their children are accessing online.\"On Defendant A's phone, we found graphic videos of animal cruelty, disturbing notes, and posts glorifying violence.\"Additional reporting by PA MediaListen to the best of BBC Radio London onSoundsand follow BBC London onFacebook,XandInstagram.

It is used by media and spectators alike.In the hours after thesensational fifth Test between England and Indiaended, with the ground emptying, on that staircase was found a left shoe, then some underwear, then a right shoe.Because of their size, they presumably belonged to a man. Quite how the owners misplaced them, or when they realised their loss, is unclear. However, it raises the prospect that someone left this famous old ground both shoeless and pantless.It would have been entirely in keeping with the mayhem that had already played out on Monday morning.There had been 57 minutes of the most intense, dramatic and emotional sport you could ever wish to see.Twenty-five days of gripping Test cricket came down to a one-armed man painfully scampering 22 yards of south London turf. One wonders how the productivity of the UK was affected at the beginning of the working week, or how many offices in Mumbai, Kolkata and Bengaluru closed early.There had been an element of farce to the previous evening. Players went to the dressing rooms because of rain and bad light when the game was on a knife-edge, then stayed there as the gloom turned to evening sunshine.Any frustration over the events of Sunday turned into anticipation of what might be possible on Monday. Thirty-five runs or four wickets. The Oval was sold out, but would anyone bother to turn up?Turn up they did, filling this historic venue with constant noise and nervous energy. There were echoes of the2005 Ashes classic in Birmingham, when Edgbaston was full for what might have only been two deliveries of action. Just like then, there was a rich reward for turning up. India's six-run win here is the narrowest of its kind in this country since England beat Australia by two runs 20 years ago.England-India Test series best since 2005 Ashes - AgnewPublished10 hours agoWho pressed their Ashes case? Who disappointed? England's player ratingsPublished8 hours agoIndia win all-time classic despite Woakes heroicsPublished12 hours agoIndia began the day with a huddle that seemed to have every member of the touring party included. Security, chef, bus driver. England, naturally, played football.Fittingly, it was Surrey v England. When Jamie Overton took fours off each of the first two balls of the day, England had almost a quarter of the runs they required. It was the best it got.Jamie Smith has looked increasingly frazzled in his first five-Test series as a wicketkeeper. He wafted at two deliveries, then edged the third. The dhol drum of the Bharat Army beat out the rhythm of We Will Rock You, and rocked England were. When Overton was struck on the pad, umpire Kumar Dharmasena paid his own 2005 tribute with the slow finger of Rudi Koertzen.Josh Tongue had a scattergun game with the ball and found himself as the last line of defence before the stricken Chris Woakes.On Sunday evening, Woakes somehow folded his dislocated shoulder into a set of cricket whites, which sounds excruciatingly painful in itself. When Tongue had his stumps rearranged by Prasidh Krishna, security staff rushed on to the outfield, believing the match to be over. They had not been briefed that Woakes, the nicest man in cricket, is also the bravest.To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption,'Here he comes!' - Woakes comes out to bat with arm in slingEarlier this year, Woakes had a tattoo inked on his left tricep in memory of his late father Roger, who died last year. Now the same arm was strapped under his England sweater as he descended the pavilion stairs, putting his broken body on the line for the Three Lions on his chest.History will remember Woakes as a World Cup winner in both formats, an Ashes winner and one of the finest seamers in English conditions. This will trump them all. The Wizard will always be the man who tried to help England win a Test with only one functioning arm.How painful it must have been for Woakes to run three times between the wickets, his shoulder jolted by every step. Mercifully, he never faced a delivery. While Woakesplayed Jack Leach, Gus Atkinson could not ape Ben Stokes. Atkinson was bowled attempting to hit the six that would have levelled the scores and won the series.According to Stokes, Woakes' reaction in the dressing room was to \"shrug his shoulder\", which is probably the last thing he should have done.To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption,'England panicked' - Vaughan on fifth Te"

I'll scratch yours' type of situation. But in my view, there's insufficient evidence to back that up.\"I suspect that Liverpool are likely to be the biggest beneficiary of this, rather than a PIF club. Newcastle don't want to sell Isak.\"As far as Al-Hilal are concerned, there are plenty of strikers that they could have bought. It just so happens that Nunez is effectively available, and therefore they decided to pursue that as an option.\"What's the latest on Isak?Isak joined Newcastle in a £60m move from La Liga side Real Sociedad in 2022.He was the club's top scorer last season as they won the Carabao Cup, ending their 70-year wait for domestic silverware.The 25-year-old, who was reported as wanting to explore a move away from Tyneside by BBC Sport in July, was left out of the club's pre-season tour of Asia with what the club called a \"minor thigh injury\".Last week, the Sweden international trained alone at his former club Real Sociedad amid ongoing uncertainty about his future, although sources say he returned to Newcastle training on Monday.His boss Eddie Howe said Isak must \"earn the right\" to train with his squad again and, speaking to the Newcastle Chronicle, said he had not spoken to the forward since Liverpool lodged a bid.The Newcastle boss, speaking before he travelled back home with his squad from South Korea, added that Liverpool, as far as he was aware, had not been back in touch since making their offer.Related topicsLiverpoolPremier LeagueNewcastle UnitedFootballMore on this storyMonday Night Club: Pivotal season for Spurs, no more egos at Rangers & Man Utd pre-season success"

England's player ratingsTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption,India win dramatic final Test by six runs to clinch series drawMatthew HenryBBC Sport journalistPublished7 hours ago973 CommentsIt was a series for the ages. The best in the UK since 2005? It's hard to argue.For the first time since 2004 the game went into the fifth day in all five Tests in the series, leaving players on both the England and India sides to summon energy from their depths.From England there was so much good before theyultimately fell shortof winning a five-Test series for the first time since 2018.The result is a squad that will remain largely settled going forward to the Ashes in Australia in November. There will not, and should not, be wholesale changes.Some have pushed their case but there remains a feeling that others could have done more.Here's how we rated the 16 players England used across the series. You can share your verdict in the comments below.Ben Duckett:The opener's 149 to set up victory in the first Test was an all-timer of a knock. That he reached 12 in all but one of his seven innings afterwards yet did not make another century was disappointing. Still, given he provides fast starts, is the consistent run-getter in England's opening partnership and is growing as an influential leader who will take the fight to Australia, Duckett remains one of England's most important players.7Zak Crawley:The right-hander ended the series with no hundreds and an average of 32.22, effectively matching that of his 59-Test career. It means calls for England to move him on will not go away. That remains highly unlikely, however. Captain Ben Stokes and the management regularly pointed to the partnerships he shared with Duckett - 188 in the fourth innings at Headingley, 166 at Manchester and 92 at The Oval - and still believe he is best suited to the pacey, bouncy pitches in Australia. After all of the backing, it would be a massive call to change now.5Ollie Pope:Similarly, this was the most Pope of series, with 106 in his first innings and only one fifty afterwards. The discrepancy between his record in the first and second innings - 46.7 compared to 19.8 - remains a concern and did not improve against India. His place is in more doubt because of how highly England rate Bethell, but Pope is more likely than not to remain at number three. His captaincy in Stokes' absence at The Oval was uninspiring.5Joe Root:537 runs, three centuries and an average of 67.1. Thankfully for England, Root shows no sign of slowing down. For them to have a chance in Australia, Root will surely have to score his first Test ton down under.9To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption,Siraj bowls Crawley for 14 with the last delivery of day threeHarry Brook:Two hundreds and a 99 make this Brook's best home summer. Another banker for the Ashes. England will need him at his best.8Ben Stokes:Stokes back bowling at full tilt, taking 17 wickets across 140 overs, was the biggest plus of England's summer. Their captain's 141 at Old Trafford was also welcome and will quieten any talk of a batting decline. The Oval defeat, which he sat out because of injury, showed how crucial his captaincy and leadership remains, and the 34-year-old is confident he will be fit from his shoulder injury to play a full part in Australia. If he's not, England have no chance.9Jamie Smith:Smith's 184 not out in the second Test at Edgbaston was arguably the knock of the series.It showedwhy England rate him so highly. Concerning, though, was how his summer tailed off with scores of eight, nine, eight and two in his final four innings. He looked tired physically and mentally at The Oval where he failed to take England over the line on the fifth morning. Australia could be even harder on body and mind.7Chris Woakes:Woakes deserves a 10 for his bravery in batting in a sling during the Oval finale alone.It should endear a double World Cup winner and modern-day stalwart even further to the English sporting public. There are caveats - the flat pitches and the fact he was the only England bowler to play in all five Tests - but 11 wickets at an average of 52.1 hinted at a bowler coming towards the end. His shoulder injury could yet rule him out of Australia but England may have moved on anyway.6To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.This video can not be playedMedia caption,'Here he comes!' - Woakes comes out to bat with arm in slingBrydon Carse:Nine wickets at 60.9 across four matches does not reflect how well Carse bowled at times in his first home summer as a Test cricketer. He was England's best seamer in the first two Tests and his two wickets in the second innings at Lord's broke open the game.He will have a big part to play this winter.7Josh Tongue:Tongue's series is the hardest to evaluate.

Mohamed Salah netted the opener and later skied a penalty.\"In both games we created a lot of chances and scored seven goals. That's very pleasing to see,\" said boss Slot.'Hard to put a lid on' Ngumoha hypeNgumoha, who turns 17 later this month, shone again in pre-season to get fans wondering if he could be part of the first team this year.The second youngest Liverpool player in a competitive game ever started this friendly on the left wing - and he caught the eye as he has done all summer.The teenager scored in just the second minute as he ran onto a loose ball in his own half before racing forward and curling a fine effort in from 20 yards out.Just three minutes later he nodded a Doak cross down for Darwin Nunez to convert from close range.Liverpool fans were singing his name as Curtis Jones urged them to show their appreciation.And he caused the La Liga side all kinds of problems with his dribbling and trickery.The 16-year-old left to a standing ovation midway through the second half.\"He is such an excellent prospect,\" said ex-Reds defender Gary Gillespie on LFC TV.\"The difficult is managing expectations but it's hard to put a lid on it.\"Slot said: \"Rio is showing things every time in pre-season.\"Ngumoha's performance came on the back of an assist against AC Milan and goal against Yokohama F. Marinos in Asian friendlies.He looks a fine talent, if raw, and will be hoping more first-team competitive games are on the way.In January, Ngumoha became the youngest player to start a match for Liverpool  - aged 16 years and 135 days old - in the 4-0 win over Accrington in the FA Cup.But that was his only first-team appearance and he never made the bench for a Premier League game.That could well change this season, especially with so many changes in the Liverpool front line.The sad death of centre forward Diogo Jota in a car crash has been the main focus of Liverpool's pre-season.There were tributes to himbefore and during the game at Anfield.Winger Luis Diaz was sold to Bayern Munich andNunez is a target for Saudi Pro League clubs.An exit for Nunez would mean the Reds' only really strong frontline options would be Salah, new signing Ekitike and Gakpo - giving a chance for somebody like Ngumoha to break through.That is unless they managed to sign Newcastle striker Alexander Isak.An initial bid of £110m has been rejected.\"I'm not trying to rush because I'm still only young,\" said Ngumoha last week.\"But at the same time, I just want to show the manager what I can do and not get too complacent. I just want to do bigger and better things for me and the club.\"Ngumoha is not actually a Liverpool academy product, having only joined Liverpool from Chelsea's youth set-up last summer.At the time Blues legend John Terry wrote \"this boy is and will be a top player\".He's not looking wrong.Slot's Liverpool 2.0 show promising signsImage source,Getty ImagesImage caption,Cody Gakpo - flanked here by summer signings Florian Wirtz and Milos Kerkez - netted twiceSlot managed the remarkable achievement of winning the Premier League title in his first season despite barely making a signing - only fringe player Federico Chiesa arrived.But now he is building a team of his own. And the signs are promising in a fluid looking 4-2-3-1.The £100m Germany attacking midfielder Wirtz shown some exciting flashes in the first half with some great touches - and went close to scoring on a few occasions.At right-back Frimpong had similarities to his predecessor Trent Alexander-Arnold, now at Real Madrid - better at attacking than defending.The Dutchman got up and down the flank well at Anfield here - although did not deal with a free-kick into the box which led to Oihan Sancet's equaliser.Ex-Bournemouth left-back Kerkez looked good.

It's just so sad that Whittingham is down in Essex and allowed to take it all away from us.\"It's kind of a grieving process. It's like losing a member of your family that has always been there. Even if you don't see them all the time, when they're not there anymore, you suffer and you feel the loss.\"The club's players were sent home a week ago and are unable to train because of a lack of insurance cover.

We've not got much of that now, but it's still a cracking place and football is such a big part of it.\"I met my wife at the football.

Strangers stop me in the street and say 'hiya Les' and it feels good.\"I don't know all the names of the people who come here, but I know all the faces. We all come here for the same reason - because we care.\"That level of care means supporters, led by fans group The Shrimps' Trust, have been protesting against Whittingham's ownership of the club and demanding he sell up for years.Takeover deals have been agreed in the past but nothing has come to fruition and fans face the prospect of having no club to support in the upcoming season.\"This place is half of my life\", says Kate Barker, a fan and former chief steward for 20 years who was subsequently made honorary life vice-president. \"All my good friends are here. It's a cliche, but we are a family and we look after each other.\"We always look forward to seeing each other on a Tuesday and a Saturday, and going to see a match. We might win, lose, or draw - the result doesn't really matter. We've never let football get in the way of a good day out.\"Image source,BBC SportImage caption,Kate Barker says Morecambe FC hasn't just been her career, but the foundation of her social life and friendships\"We'll still gather together and talk about the old times, what we've done and where we've been. But we should still be able to do it here, every week,\" adds Barker.\"Inside I'm being absolutely torn apart.\"Where once on the town's seafront there were multiple fairgrounds, theatres, piers and miniature zoos, there are now a smattering of bars and restaurants, many of which are funded by matchday income and travelling away supporters.The club's peril means local businesses are now at risk.\"The winter months are the hardest here, because it's the seaside,\" says Chris Donaldson, owner of The Royal Hotel on the seafront. \"The football season sees us through that.\"I've got 19 bedrooms here and away fans are coming from all over fully booking them weeks in advance. The whole town can be full.\"It'll cost us tens of thousands, easily. It's crazy what it'll do to the town to lose that kind of money. Everyone will feel the effect of it.\"For staff at the fans' matchday pub, the difference in demeanour is already stark.\"We get around 400, 500 people on a matchday,\" says Michael Woolworth, manager of the Hurley Flyer opposite the stadium. \"It feels like everyone in Morecambe is in here.\"It's a ritual every weekend.

Here's how to protect yourselfAugust 4, 20255:08 PM ETByAlejandra Borunda,Julia SimonPeople play rugby in the hazy weather on July 27, 2025 in New York City. There are currently smoke advisories across the Midwest and Northeast as a result of wildfires in Canada.Liao Pan/China News Service/VCG via Getty Imageshide captiontoggle captionLiao Pan/China News Service/VCG via Getty ImagesThis story is updated to reflect the current wildfire smoke conditions in the U.S. The original story was publishedJan. 8, 2025.Smoke from Canadian wildfires continued to prompt air quality alerts Monday in the Northeast U.S. as well as the Upper Midwest.Michigan saw astatewide air quality advisoryon Monday, and while Minnesota is seeing some relief, the wildfire smoke ispersisting in Wisconsin, andspreading across New York,Vermont, andMaine.Canada is experiencing its second worst wildfire season on record, according to government data. There have been nearly 4,000 fires recorded already this calendar year.Sponsor MessageExposure to wildfire smoke is a growing health problem across the country, as human-caused climate change increases the risk and intensity of wildfires and the smoke that can drift thousands of miles downwind from them.Here's what you need to know about the health risks — and how to protect yourself.The health risks of breathing wildfire smokeMay-Lin Wilgus, a pulmonologist and professor at UCLA, compares breathing wildfire smoke to smoking cigarettes – a lot of cigarettes.Scientists track air quality with theair quality index, or AQI, which incorporates different pollution sources like ozone and fine particulates. Many scientists don't think there's a \"safe\" AQI level becausethe measurement doesn't capture many harmful pollutants, but under 50 is often considered acceptable. Higher numbers indicate more health-damaging pollution in the air.OnMonday the AQI in Detroit was at least 159. On a smoky day, when AQI levels reach 100 to 200, \"the exposure to the fine particulate matter, the air pollution, is similar to smoking aquarter to half a pack a day,\" Wilgus says.That exposure takes a toll on a healthy person. But it is particularly harmful for those with pre-existing health issues, Wilgus adds. Emergency room visits for respiratory issues like asthma and COPDincrease dramaticallyduring wildfire smoke events, as much asdoubling in somecases. During the Canadian wildfires in 2023, when smoke wafted across much of the U.S., emergency room visits for asthmaincreased by nearly 20%.Sponsor MessageSmoke exposure can alsoworsen other medical conditions. Emergency departments see morecardiovascularrelated visits after smoky days. And a growing body of research suggests smoke exposure is linked to long-term impacts such as a higher risk ofdeveloping dementia.Overall, air quality has improved in the U.S. over the past 20 years, says Tarik Benmarhnia, a climate and health scientist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego. But wildfire smoke iserasing many of those gains.\"Just maybe like ten years ago wildfire was an exceptional issue. It was something that happens once in a lifetime for most people,\" he says.But climate change has increased the chance of wildfires across many parts of the country, and the intensity of many of the burns themselves and the smoke they produce.\"This is unfortunately not the first one and not the last one the people in Los Angeles are going to be experiencing,\" Benmarhnia says.Wondering what AQI is safe and what activities are safe at different AQIs? Life Kitexplains.The dangers of breathing wildfire smokeWildfires burn at extremely high temperatures, which makes their ash more toxic than other pollution, such as car exhaust. But in many cases, including during these ongoing fires,it's not just trees and organic matter that burn. Homes, cars and other materials go up in flames, too, adding potentially harmful particles to the pollution load.\"It's just a toxic soup,\" says Lisa Miller, a wildfire smoke expert at the University of California, Davis. \"Think of all the synthetic fibers that are present in your living room – in your couch, in your carpet, in your clothes. All those things can be particularly toxic\" if they go up in smoke, she says.Higher risks for some peopleWildfire smoke is hazardous for everyone, but it's especially dangerous for some people, including children and older adults, pregnant people and anyone with preexisting health problems.Sponsor MessageFirst responders and firefighters are exposed to the worst of the smoke. A 2019 study found that heavy, repeated smoke exposure among wildland firefighters is linked withhigher risks of lung cancer and cardiovascular disease.Children can beespecially vulnerable, doctors say, because they breathe in more air – and therefore more smoke – relative to their body size.Pregnant people should also take care, says Miller.

It needs Democrats in the room, even if it doesn't need their votes, in order to enact the new map.\"If you're the minority party, and you can't block any legislation, one nuclear option you always have is to walk out, thereby preventing the legislature from engaging in any activity and particularly passing legislation,\" explains Mark P.

I'm Dave Davies. For decades, Iran has been a major preoccupation of U.S. policymakers for its nuclear program, its threats to Israel and its backing of armed extremist groups in the Middle East. But go back a half a century, and Iran was a very different place. Our guest today, journalist Scott Anderson, has taken a close look at the Iranian Revolution of 1979, the violent upheaval that transformed the country from one of America's closest allies into the Islamic republic that regards the United States as the Great Satan. Before that, the country was governed by the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, a monarch who ruled with political repression while seeking to modernize his nation's economy and social relations.In a new book, Anderson writes that the Iranian Revolution had far-reaching effects, contributing to the rise of Islamic extremism. He says it marked the modern world's first successful religious counter revolution against the forces of secularism and was in some ways as significant as the American, French and Russian revolutions. His gripping account of the conflict suggests that the outcome was far from inevitable and that many factors, including the shah's personal failings and the inattention and poor decisions of American policymakers, contributed to the victory of Ayatollah Khomeini.DAVIES: Scott Anderson is a veteran war correspondent who has reported from Lebanon, Israel, Egypt, Northern Ireland, Chechnya, Sudan, Bosnia and other countries. He's the author of seven previous books. His latest is \"King Of Kings: The Iranian Revolution: A Story Of Hubris, Delusion And Catastrophic Miscalculation.\" I spoke to Scott Anderson last week.Well, Scott Anderson, welcome back to FRESH AIRSCOTT ANDERSON: Thank you, Dave. It's good to be back.DAVIES: I have to congratulate you on this book. It really is just a terrific gripping read. There is so much fascinating detail here. I just want to let the audience know there's more than we can get to, but there's plenty there. You know a lot about the Middle East. I mean, you traveled through it with your dad, who was - worked for the State...ANDERSON: Yes.DAVIES: ...Department when you were a kid. And you opened this book with a scene from Washington, D.C., in late 1977, when the Shah of Iran, on the throne for decades, came to America's capital for his first visit with the new president, Jimmy Carter. You happened to be there because you were a low-level treasury department, and you witnessed some events outside the White House. You want to just share this little scene with us?ANDERSON: Sure. Yeah. So it was mid-November 1977, the shah came on a state visit, and some 4,000 anti-shah demonstrators, mostly Iranian students studying in the United States, arrived in Washington to protest his visit. And meanwhile, the Iranian government had shipped in pro-shah demonstrators to kind of face off with them. And so when the shah arrived and he had just reached the White House, all of a sudden, there was a pitch battle on the Ellipse, the Ellipse being this great lawn just below the White House. And I happened to be there. I was kind of wandering around. I was stationed at the treasury headquarters, which is right next door to the White House. And I had just wandered over, and I was kind of in no man's land between these two groups - the anti-shah and the pro-shah demonstrators. And all of a sudden, the two sides broke through the snow fencing that was keeping them back and charged each other.And I happened to be at ground zero. I got knocked to the ground. Well, a lot of people got knocked to the ground. It turned out to be the most violent day of civil unrest in Washington you'd seen in almost a decade. And the thing about this day was, unfortunately, for the shah, it was being shown on live TV back in Iran. And the way a lot of people interpreted this event - and there was tear gas, the shah and President Carter were tear gassed on the South Lawn. A lot of Iranians saw this as a move by the Americans to distance themselves from the shah because why else would they let the shah be humiliated in the American capital?DAVIES: Right. In their country, if something like that ha"

Last week, the Labor Department reported that thejob market weakened sharply duringthe late spring and early summer as President Trump's tariffs began to take effect. Hours after the report, Trump made a social media post calling for the firing of the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Erika McEntarfer, who releases the job reports.LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - JUNE 02: A 'Now Hiring' sign is displayed outside a resale clothing shop on June 2, 2023 in Los Angeles, California. Today's U.S. labor report shows that employers added 339,000 jobs in May with sectors including construction, healthcare, business services and transportation adding jobs with wages showing 4.3 percent growth over the same period last year.

Witkoff informed them that Trump is working to reach a deal to help bring the hostages home. This comes a week after ceasefire talks stalled and many across the globe expressed outrage over mounting hunger in Gaza.🎧Videos surfaced over the weekend showing two men who were kidnapped at the NOVA music festival.In the footage was an emaciated hostage who said he feared he was digging his own grave, according to NPR's Eleanor Beardsley. Last night, a person familiar with the details informed NPR that among Israeli officials, there is an understanding that Hamas is uninterested in a deal and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is pushing for hostage release through military defeat.

The move has triggered widespread upset and legal complaints.https://p.dw.com/p/4yVGrThe zoo said it had exhausted all other options, having sought to relocate the animalsImage: Daniel Karmann/dpa/picture allianceAdvertisementNurembergZoo has confirmed that baboons killed to keep down numbers were fed to predators, amid public criticism after it was revealed the animals had been dismembered after death.News of the culling sparked complaintsfrom animal groups over zoo ethics, animal welfare, and culling practices, with the animals decapitated and some having their hands and feet removed.What did the zoo say about the baboon killings?Deputy zoo director Jörg Beckmann told the DPA news agency that the skulls and brains from the bodies were separated for scientific purposes.Six of the 12 Guinea baboons, which were culled due to overcrowding, were then fed to lions, tigers, maned wolves and marbled polecats. Hands and feet were removed \"out of respect for visitors\" who would see the carnivores feeding, Beckmann said.Skeletons of four baboons are being prepared for museum display, the zoo said. Two baboons died during sedation and were sent for pathology rather than being used as feed.Beckmann said the zoo had openlycommunicated in advance that the baboons would be used as food.\"We continue to be transparent and stand by that decision,\" he said. He explained that whole-animal feeding provides crucial dental health benefits for carnivores, as bones and fur help prevent tartar buildup, unlike processed food. \"Unlike many pets, our animals don't need tartar removal under general anesthesia.\"He also emphasized the behavioral benefits of such feeding practices, which mimic natural hunting conditions.\"Evolution equipped them with claws and teeth for this. There's no nature documentary about big predators where they don't spectacularly hunt or feed on a carcass.\"The zoo had said the baboons were killed because the enclosure was chronically overcrowded and no longer met welfare standards. Attempts to rehome the animals failed, and contraceptive measures for the females had not worked as hoped.Tons of ice keep polar bears cool in Prague ZooTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 videoIn a statement last week, the zoo said it acknowledged the emotional impact of the move, saying it understood that many people are \"confused, affected, or angry.\"The zoo explained that the group had grown to more than 40 animals—far exceeding the enclosure's intended capacity of 25 adult baboons.What has been the reaction?Animal welfare groups reacted strongly. The Nuremberg-Fürth public prosecutor's office confirmed it had received hundreds of criminal complaints over the allegedly unlawful killings and is now reviewing the case.The activist group Animal Rebellion began setting up a protest camp near the zoo on Monday. The camp is expected to remain until the following Monday, with organizers demanding an immediate halt to further killings and an end to breeding programs.In a statement, the zoo said: \"Every protest that remains peaceful is acceptable to us.\"Why did the zoo says the baboon cull was necessary?Nuremberg Zoo said the culling was a last resort after years of trying to control the baboon population through non-lethal means, with contraception having only a limited effect and disrupting natural group dynamics.Despite outreach to many institutions, no suitable home was found for the surplus animals.Expanding the facility again wasn’t feasible due to space and funding priorities. The zoo said it could not stop breeding entirely without undermining its long-term conservation role, which requires maintaining healthy, reproducing populations.Edited by: Wesley RahnRichard ConnorReporting on stories from around the world, with a particular focus on Europe — especially Germany.Send us your feedbackYour feedbackAdvertisement"

Previously, parents whose children were born after 1992 received a slightly higher percentage.CSU General Secretary Martin Huber called the move the \"completion\" of the mother's pension plan, and said that 10 million women would profit. \"For many female pensioners, this rise makes a big difference,\" he told theRNDnews network.For this elderly German shopkeeper, retirement not an optionTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 videoWho does the mother's pension benefit?Though the change will iron out a disparity between the pensions received by older and younger generations, experts say the measure does nothing to close the gender pay gap between men and women, or indeed overall inequality in the country. Despite the name, all parents are eligible for the \"mother's pension,\" as are foster parents and grandparents, if the child lived with them for a significant amount of time.Peter Haan, specialist in state finance policy at the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW), and co-author of a study on the pension, thinks it's not an effective way to close the \"gender pension gap.\"The key question, as far as Haan is concerned, is who actually benefits. It does, he admitted, make superficial sense for older mothers to get the same benefits as those who had their children after 1992. \"But the pensions for that generation were significantly higher than for the younger generation,\" Haan told DW. \"And secondly, it's a 'watering can' measure that is equal for all mothers, and so doesn't specifically do anything to combat poverty among older people.\"The €20 per child per month might certainly be useful for many older people with lower incomes, but the very poorest women won't profit from it anyway — because the \"mother's pension\" is actually deducted from any welfare benefits they receive.Helping families — especially Bavarian onesThe mother's pension dates back to 2013, when the CSU pushed through the plan underAngela Merkel's government as a way to compensate parents — in practice mainly mothers —  who took time off to raise children and therefore paid less into the pension system.Since then, the CSU has made the plan one of its key policies, not least because it is popular among its own Bavarian electorate —many of whom are older people. In the intervening years, keeping the mother's pension has been the CSU's line in the sand in negotiations with its coalition partners the CDU and the center-leftSocial Democratic Party(SPD).\"Backing down on this issue would be unthinkable for a CSU leader,\" political scientist Ursula Münch, director of the Tutzing Academy for Political Education in Bavaria, told DW. \"If the other parties do not meet it, it will refuse to support their proposals while playing on public opinion in an ageing society.\"Germany's labor shortage: Lufthansa turns to retireesTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 videoHelping the old at the expense of the youngBut the idea is also unpopular among Germany's business community, who have been hoping that Merz's conservative government would, instead of increasing pensions, do more to keep more people on the job market. \"All this is going completely in the wrong direction,\" said Judith Röder of the Federal Association of Wholesale, Foreign Trade and Services (BGA). \"Everything that leads to increased welfare spending is a problem, and anything that signals less employment in an ageing society is also bad.

He fled his homeland in April 2006, after the area came under heavy shelling during Sri Lanka's civil war.The conflict, which spanned from the mid 1980s to 2009, was primarily a struggle between the Sinhalese majority and the Tamil minority, with the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) — also known as theTamil Tigers— fighting government forces for an independent state.When he returned after the conflict had ended, he and 107 others found their farming land was under government control. They said attempts to farm on their land were met with threats of arrest, and a fence was later erected to stop them from gaining access.To date, they say they have not received any compensation.Now, their land has been allocated as the site for a newsolar powerplant to be built as a collaborative project between Sri Lanka's Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) andIndia'sstate-owned National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC).Indian Prime MinisterNarendra Modiand Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake jointly inaugurated the projectduring Modi's visit to Sri Lanka in April.A battle for compensationThe land belonging to Chitravelayutham and the other villagers was designated as a high-security zone in 2008, at the height of the civil war.Kandumani Lavakusarasa, the coordinator of the AHAM Humanitarian Resource Center in Trincomalee, said over 500 acres had now been allocated for the solar power plant.Of that total, he said 147 acres used to be farming land belonging to villagers including Chitravelayutham, and a further 58 acres was residential land.Modi (left) signed a raft of defense and energy deals to boost relations with Sri LankaImage: Ishara S.

The scientists are now hoping it will unlock vital information about theEarth's climate.\"Ice cores are climate archives, so they tell us something about the climate history of the Earth,\" said Maria Hörhold, glaciologist at theAlfred Wegener Institute (AWI),where one of the samples is being studied.The core contains air bubbles allowing scientists to measure the quantities ofgreenhouse gases, like CO2,held in the atmosphere over the last 1.2 million years.Researchers hope the ice samples will unlock more secrets about Earth's carbon cycleImage: PNRA_IPEVThey hope the ice core could help scientists better understand climate change by shedding more light on the connection between the carbon cycle and the temperatures on the planet.Improving predictions on climateIn past ice core samples, researchers were able to see alternating hot periods with cold, or glacial periods, that took place approximately every 100,000 years. But looking further back, the cold temperatures occurred more frequently — around every 40,000 years.\"This is mainly driven, for example, by planetary features, like how the Earth is positioned towards the Sun,\" Hörhold told DW. \"But people do not really know why we shifted from a 40,000-year cycle at say 1.5 million years ago to what we have today.\"By extending the 800,000-year-old ice core record and figuring out why the cycle changed, researchers hope to \"improve predictions of how Earth's climate may respond to future greenhouse gas increases,\" said Liz Thomas of theBritish Antarctic Survey.\"There is no other place on Earth that retains such a long record of the past atmosphere as Antarctica,\" added Thomas in a statement. \"It's our best hope to understand the fundamental drivers of Earth's climate shifts.\"Scientists spent months drilling to reach the ancient ice so they could extend the ice recordImage: PNRA_IPEVCO2 concentrations higher than everScientists already know that concentrations of greenhouse gases, like CO2, were lower during colder periods on Earth. Whileduring warmer times,a build-up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere prevented heat from escaping.\"The idea is that you understand how the climate internally interacts, so how do atmospheric patterns interact, how does ice sheet elevation interact with sea level, and so on,\" she told DW, adding that studying the ice core would hopefully improve their understanding of those interactions.However, she added that even during previous warm periods in Earth's history, CO2 concentrations were much lower than they are today. The current high levels are primarily the result of human-driven global warming, caused by the burning of fossil fuels like oil and gas.A project across EuropeThe pan-European ice core study is part of theBeyond EPICA – Oldest Iceproject.The ice sample has been cut into one-meter length pieces.

But the numerous occasions African leaders have sought treatment abroad have thrown the spotlight onlocal health care investment. To a large extent, leaders are responsible for the development of proper health care for the citizens of their countries.The deaths of former leadersMuhammadu BuhariofNigeriaandEdgar LunguofZambiain foreign medical facilities have not calmed accusations that African leaders neglect public health systems in their own countries.\"The state of health care in Nigeria is deeply concerning. The biggest problem is infrastructure. There are no drugs and functional medical equipment,\" Jamila Atiku, a researcher on public health in Nigeria, told DW.Nigeria nurses' strike disrupts health care servicesTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 videoLow investment in public healthReasons for medical tourism include a lack of specialized treatment available locally, poorly equipped hospitals and security fears for politicians.Another factor, according toZimbabweanhealth rights advocate Chamunorwa Mashoko, is an over-reliance on foreign aid.\"Among African countries, over 32 out of 54 countries are not allocating significant budgets to health. This is motivated by overdependency on donor aid,\" he told DW.Former Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari died in London aged 82Image: ADRIAN DENNIS/AFP\"Africa is failing to realize that foreign funding in health is just for diplomacy. Those assisting us with all that aid really has nothing to do with our health challenges,\" Mashoko added.African countries receive more than $60 billion (€52 billion) in health funding, representing just a fraction of the total health financing needed for the continent.Under the 2001 Abuja Declaration,African Union (AU)member states committed to end the continent's health financing crisis by pledging to allocate 15% of their annual national budgets to health care.But over two decades later, only three countries, Rwanda, Botswana, and Cape Verde, have consistently met or exceeded the target.TheWorld Health Organization (WHO)reports that over 30 AU member states allocate less than 10% of their budget to health care, with some allocating as little as 5-7%.\"Nigeria has been fluctuating between 4-6% of the annual budget,\" said Atiku, adding that politicians are only concerned about other infrastructure development projects like roads.\"Doctors and health care professionals are always going on strike because they are underpaid.\"Many African countries still lack specialized treatment, leading to medical tourismImage: Fabrice Caterini/Inediz/MSFInadequate public financing of health has resulted in poorly run, underperforming health systems across many African countries.\"Over-reliance on external funding is highly unsustainable and inconsistent with achieving Universal Health Coverage,\" said Itai Rusike, of the Zimbabwe-based Community Working Group on Health.\"The Abuja target of 15% allocation to health has remained an elusive target. It is now outdated given the population increase, huge disease burden and the levels of neglect of infrastructure and health worker retention,\" Rusike added.Which medical services are sought abroadA chronic lack of specialized treatment and facilities is driving many African patients to seek medical treatment abroad. The sectors affected include oncology, cardiology, neurology, orthopedics, organ transplants, fertility, and pediatrics for the management of rare genetic disorders.Over 300,000 Africans travel toIndiaannually for medical services, spending more than $2 billion each year.India is said to be generatingmore than $6 billion each year from medical tourism.Projections show the Asian country could get $13 billion in medical tourism by 2026 under the \"Heal in India\" initiative.According to the African Journal of Hospitality, Tourism and Leisure, Nigerians are estimated to spend $1 billion annually on medical tourism. 60% of that amount is spent on oncology, orthopedics, nephrology, and cardiology. Additionally, the figure represents almost 20% of the annual public health expenditure that covers the salaries of health workers.An estimated 5,000 Nigerians fly out of the country monthly for medical treatment, many traveling to India.What needs to be doneSome African health authorities argue they are doing their best to improve healthcare for their countries.\"There is room for improvement to fund the health sect"

One 72-year-old mother of three children took to the floor and attacked her in front of the audience as an egoist, Brandner told DW.However, the book, in which the Austrian-born and Berlin-based Brandner explains, with great humor and frankness, why she never wanted to become pregnant and underwent sterilization for that reason, also drew many positive reactions.Speaking about the hate that she has experienced from several quarters, she said: \"You get stamped as a revolutionary. If you say you don't want children, you are very quickly blamed for sabotaging the pension system and the intergenerational contract, and actually for singlehandedly bringing about the extinction of the human race.\"This criticism is fueled by a number that many young women celebrate as a sign of progress in female self-determination, but that others see as a fearful portent of dwindling prosperity and a continuously shrinking population: 1.35.Julia Brandner wants to remain child-freeImage: Andy SparklesThat's theaverage number of children had by womenin Germany in 2024, according to the Federal Statistical Office. The average birth rate for women with German nationality was just 1.23, a figure that rose to 1.89 for non-German nationals. In total, 677,117 children were born in Germany in 2024, a decrease of 15,872 from the year before.Far-right AfD calls to boost birth rateBrandner was 28 years old when she was sterilized. Her gynecologist demanded a psychiatric assessment of her mental capacity before carrying out the operation.Brandner was surprised by the controversy caused by her book. She said she is noticing an increasing rightward shift in these tumultuous times, along with a return to more \"traditional\" values, where women stand at the stove and are supposed to look after the children.The far-rightAlternative for Germany party (AfD)has also latched onto the topic of the sinking fertility rate and is calling for more children instead of immigration as a way to combat the lack of skilled workers.Brandner feels that even in 2025, the topic of children is still very widely seen as something that concerns just women. \"The many single mothers are being left to cope on their own, while fathers are often let off the hook. For women, having children puts them at huge risk of poverty. It can't be that even today a woman has to give up her prosperity to ensure the prosperity of society,\" she said.Child-free for the climateTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 videoFertility rates sinking worldwideBut Germany isn't the only country experiencing a sinking fertility rate, by far.Numbers are going down drastically across the world, reaching as low as 0.75 in South Korea.Vietnam rang alarm bellsearlier this year, when its birth rate hit a record low. The only exception is the Sahel zone, where women are still having more than five children on average.Michaela Kreyenfeld is a sociologist and was one of the experts behind the German government's family report. She sees a growing connection between economic crises and uncertainties and the birth rate. \"Is it egoism or simply autonomous behavior that women don't want to have any children? We have been talking about that since the 1970s at least, so it's nothing new,\" she told DW.What is new, she said, are the multiple crises: \"TheCOVID pandemic, rampantclimate changeand high inflation. For the young generation in particular, that is a new situation,\" said Kreyenfeld.A countermovement in the US is trying to buck the trend, with the richest man in the world as its most prominent representative: Pronatalists andElon Muskwant to bring as many children into the world as possible.However, Kreyenfeld pointed to Romania as an example from eastern European history that can serve as a warning. \"President Ceausescu used extreme measures, such as limiting access to contraceptives and imposing draconian penalties for abortions, to push the birth rate from 1.8 to four within a year. The result was the 'lost generation' in Romania: the generation in which parents didn't look after their children because they didn't want them.\"Choosing to be a child-free woman in India (January 2024)To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 videoHow can Germany bridge the 'fertility gap'?So, what can be done to raise the birth rate again without state p"

In combination with selected cellphones and the contents of scanned social media channels, a comprehensive profile of any person appears in an instant.With the help ofartificial intelligence(AI), the surveillance program developed by the US technology company seems to make the dreams of police and intelligence agencies come true.Three of Germany's 16 federal states are already using Gotham:Bavaria,HesseandNorth Rhine-Westphalia.Baden-Württembergis planning to implement it soon.However, according to privacy advocates and civil rights organizations, it comes with a big problem: Along with those suspected of a crime, it can also ensnare innocent people.How facial recognition cameras identify you with AITo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 videoThe German nonprofit groupSociety for Civil Rights (GFF)is fundamentally opposed to the use of programs like Palantir.

According to current law, police in Bavaria may use the Palantir software even when there is no indication of danger.

Its spokesperson, Constanze Kurz, spoke of a \"Palantir dragnet investigation\" in which police were linking separately stored data for very different purposes than those originally intended.\"This is reason enough for this automated mass analysis not to become an everyday tool for police.

More than 30 years later, their demands have finally been met.In late July, Czech President Petr Pavel signed an amendment to his country's criminal code that criminalizes the promotion ofcommunist ideology, placing it on the same footing as Nazi propaganda. The amendment will enter into force on January 1, 2026.The movement to amend the law was first initiated by Martin Mejstrik, formerly a leader of the student protests during the Velvet Revolution and later a Czech senator. Historians from the Czech Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes, or the USTR, also joined the initiative and this spring, the amendment passed through the Czech political system, supported by Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala's pro-European coalition government. President Pavel's signature in July finalized the process.Martin Mejstrik, a former student revolutionary and Czech senator, has led the charge to pass the new amendment on communist propagandaImage: Michaela Rihova/CTK Photo/IMAGOThe amendment of section 403 of the Czech criminal code now allots a jail sentence of one to five years for anyone who \"establishes, supports or promotes Nazi, communist, or other movements which demonstrably aim to suppress human rights and freedoms or incite racial, ethnic, national, religious or class-based hatred.\"'Criminal totalitarian ideologies'\"The aim of this draft was to eliminate an obviously unfair distinction between two criminal totalitarian ideologies of the 20th century,\" Kamil Nedvedicky, a deputy director at the USTR, had explained before the amendment was passed.Both of those ideologies suppressed fundamental rights and freedoms, he said. \"It is logical and just that Czech criminal law clearly reflects this. It's not about ideology, it's about protecting the democratic constitutional state,\" he said.Czech President Petr Pavel signed an amendment to his country's criminal code in late JulyImage: Roman Vondrous/CTK/picture alliance/dpaSomewhat ironically, theCzech Republicis also one of the few countries in the European Union that has a comparatively successful communist party. The Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia, or KSCM, was formed in 1990 and until the last Czech parliamentary election four years ago, had members of parliament and even provided several Czech vice presidents.The KSCM was the offspring of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, a dictatorial regime with a Marxist-Leninist ideology that ruled the country until 1989. The KSCM has tens of thousands of members and entered theEuropean Parliamentafter the 2024 EU elections as part of the left-wing Stacilo! (in English, \"Enough!\") coalition. Polling indicates the Stacilo! electoral alliance will likely get over the 5% hurdle in the Czech Republic's October parliamentary elections too. Its lead candidate is KSCM leader and member of the European Parliament, Katerina Konecna.Possible ruling role for communistsAnd that may not be all. The current favorite in domestic elections is Andrej Babis, a former Czech prime minister, oligarch and the leader of theright-wing populistparty, ANO (in English, \"YES\"). Babis has not ruled out working with Stacilo! to form a new coalition.Andrej Babis, leader of the right-wing populist party, ANO, is a favorite in October parliamentary elections and may be open to working with the communist partyImage: Lukas Kabon/AA/picture allianceThe new amendment to Czech law could potentially even lead to a ban on the KSCM. That happened to the Workers' Party, a Czech far-right, extremist and neo-Nazi party, in 2010.KSCM leader Konecna told DW that the amendment is a political attack on her party by the current government.\"It's about the systematic attempt by the antisocial, corrupt government of Petr Fiala to silence its loudest critics,\" she argued. \"That definitely has no place in a democratic society.\"Konecna also said it was \"amusing\" that the amendment was signed into law by Pavel, who was previously a prominent member of the original Czech Communist Party.Pavel, a former career soldier, was a member of the Communist Party until 1989. \"In retrospect and with the knowledge I have today, it was a decision I am definitely not proud of,\" the Czech president has previously "

For example, tanks are being manufactured and repaired there and an ammunition factory being built.'Huge change' in German attitudes\"We are seeing a huge change in Germany's approach toward Ukraine, a complete opening up,\" Ihor Fedirko, the chief executive of the Ukrainian Council of Defense Industry (UCDI= told DW.Direct investments by the German government into Ukrainian drone and missile production are still a relative novelty. According toDie Welt, a German newspaper, Germany intends to fund around 500 An-196 Liutyi drones, one-way attack, unmanned aerial vehicles. Ukrainian media reports suggest that each drone costs around $200,000 (€175,000).The drone was developed as a result of previous cooperation between Turkey and Ukraine. The An-196 Liutyi \"was already quite advanced in its development and testing,\" military expert Gustav Gressel, formerly a senior policy fellow with the European Council on Foreign Relations, explained. A very high proportion of these drones are shot down though, Gressel continued, because they fly fairly slowly, at similar speeds to comparable Russian models.Gustav Gressel is a Berlin-based expert on defense and securityImage: DWApart from funds, Ukraine is also hoping for German know-how. \"We lack deep-tech technologies,\" Fedirko explains, referring to cutting-edge engineering. \"This affects the component base. Equipped with this kind of knowledge, we could modernize more thoroughly and become more efficient,\" he said. Germany has these technologies.Currently Ukraine is asking all of its allies for technology that would enable long-range weapons, Fedirko continued.\"We're talking about a range of between 500 and 1,000 kilometers,\" he explains. \"Some of them [the weapons] — for example, the deep-strike Liutyi, can already get to targets more than 2,000 kilometers away.\"Producing German drones in UkraineMany German defense companies getting more active in Ukraine are startups, mostly based inBavaria. One example is Quantum Systems, a firm specializing in aerial data and making unmanned aerial systems to collect it.Fedirko describes this as a \"best-case scenario\" of the kind of cooperation Ukraine wants.Founded in 2015, Quantum Systems has been supplying its Vector reconnaissance drones to the Ukrainian army since 2022. A special feature of the Vector is its ability to take off and land vertically.\"We are the only Western company producing reconnaissance drones where they are most urgently needed: on-site in Ukraine,\" says Sven Kruck, co-chief executive at Quantum Systems. His company employs around 200 people in Ukraine, and it's growing; a second production plant is scheduled to open in September.In mid-July, Quantum Systems announced that it would also acquire a 10% stake in Frontline, a Ukrainian drone manufacturer.

What can be done to help older people pay for their care?https://p.dw.com/p/4yP0QElderly people in German nursing homes now pay well over €3,000 per month in their first yearImage: Christine Bayer/DWAdvertisementThe cost ofa stay in a nursing homehas risen to an average of €3,248 ($3,760) per month, according to the German Association of Nursing Homes (vdek), an association that represents the interests of several statutory health insurance providers. This is likely to be a crippling sum for many Germans, considering thatthe average pension in Germany is around €1,100 per month.German Health Minister Nina Warken (CDU) believes there's an urgent need for reform of long-term care insurance. \"The gap between income and expenditure has now diverged dramatically. This cannot continue,\" she told the Funke Media Group newspapers.Statutory long-term care insurance has been part of the German social security system for 30 years, as part of a compulsory insurance policy shared by employers and employees. Currently, 3.6% of income is due for this contribution. However, long-term care insurance covers only a part of the costs. Almost one in three nursing home residents relies on welfare payments to supplement their income.Germany: Care work in a strained systemTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 videoBeate Linz-Esser, the managing director of the Erikaweg senior citizens' center in Hilden,North Rhine-Westphalia, told DW there was great uncertainty among the residents in her facility.\"These constantly rising care costs are a heavy burden for our residents,\" she said. \"Then there's the constant fear of not knowing how long their own income or assets will be sufficient to cover the costs.\" Residents must contribute to the care costs with their income or savings.More older people, increasing costsTheaverage life expectancy is risingfor Germans, currently standing at 79 years for men and 84 for women. In December 2023, around 5.7 million people were in need of care, according to the Federal Statistical Office, a number that is expected to increase by 37% by 2055 due to the aging population.Around 85% of elderly people are cared for at home by relatives and outpatient care assistants. The nursing care insurance fund pays them between €350 and €990, depending on the level of care required.However, many people in need of care live in nursing homes, where costs have been rising sharply for years.Children are only required to contribute to their parents' care costs if their annual gross income exceeds €100,000. This does not apply to most people, as the average annual income in Germany is around €55,000.Back in 2018, care home residents had to pay only €1,772 a month. Health care economist Heinz Rothgang said the increase can be explained primarily by two factors: \"For a long time, nursing was a poorly paid profession. But over the past 10 years, wages in nursing have risen more sharply than in the rest of the economy; by roughly double,\" he told DW. Added to this is an increase in the number of nursing staff in care homes.Care home residents have to pay not only for care, room and board, but also for maintenance and nursing training. Of the €3,248 in nursing care costs, this accounts for €1,488. And all these costs continue to rise.How Rostock recruits foreign health care staff to GermanyTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 videoLinz-Esser is particularly annoyed that almost half of the monthly fee goes into training and maintenance. \"It is unacceptable that the residents have to pay for the training of nursing staff,\" she said. \"And the investment costs — in hospitals, the state or federal government covers that. Our residents have to pay for that, too.\"Over the years, however, the out-of-pocket costs that those in need of care have to pay have decreased, making stays in a nursing home gradually less expensive for the individual resident. But the system is on the verge of collapse.What's the solution?Health Minister Warken wants to set up a reform commission to come up with a plan. This year and next, the federal government will pay €2 billion into the long-term care insurance. But taxpayers' money will only help in the short term.Rothgang has two proposals for a fundamental reform: \"One option is to introduce tax revenue into the system, federal subsidies like those already found in pension and health insurance,\" he said.\"A second possibility would be to get people to pay more, especially those with higher incomes. One could say that all income would be subject to contributions, including capital or rental income, for example,\" he added.The Federal Audit Office is also sounding the alarm, predicting a financial shortfall for the current "

But for a long time, the country had not planned to include the Roma and Sinti people murdered during the Holocaust here. It was only pressure from local civil society groups that eventually saw a Roma wheel in stone added, to commemorate the thousands of Roma people deported to their deaths in Transnistria during World War II.TheEuropean Day of Remembrance for the Genocide of Sinti and Romahas been observed annually on August 2 since 2015 when the European Parliament recognized the date.Two days before the official memorial day,Romania's new president Nicusor Danand other notable locals participated in an event in Bucharest commemorating the day.There were a large number of security personnel deployed in Bucharest that day because in the increasingly polarized political climate, precautions were needed to protect a minority that's often still scapegoated in Romania and elsewhere.The Holocaust memorial in Bucharest was opened in 2009Image: Ghement Robert/dpa/picture-allianceRomania grappling with historyThe presence of the new president,a pro-European candidatewho beat right-wing candidateGeorge Simionin May 2025 elections, was more than just symbolic. It was an appeal: Romania needs to grapple with its own history properly and it needs a basic change in a public discourse often marred byhate speech and racism.The two-hour ceremony brought together representatives from the president's office and government, European and Romanian diplomats and members of theRoma community. Between bureaucratic sobriety and the formalities, there were also powerful speeches that directly connected local and current history.Petre-Florin Manole, Romania's labor minister, argued that the country's budget deficit is often discussed more than right-wing extremism. \"But the democratic deficit is actually the most dangerous,\" Manole said. \"It cannot be remedied with isolated measures. It takes decades.\"Romania's labor minister Petre-Florin Manole (left) and the country's foreign minister, Oana ToiuImage: Cristian Ștefănescu/DWManole wasn't just speaking as a cabinet member, he is also a member of the Roma minority. In fact, he's the first Roma in the history of democratic Romania to lead a ministry.The long silence on this topic in Romanian society had rendered the victims invisible, added Mircea Dumitru, the vice-president of the cultural forum, the Romanian Academy. This commemoration was not only about a historical wound but also a warning, a reminder of what can happen \"when hatred becomes law,\" he said.Back then people were \"robbed of their freedom, their dignity and their lives — solely because of their identity, their ethnicity. That is, what they were and could not change,\" Dumitru continued.The Roma, a people \"devoured\"In Romania, \"porajmos\" is the word used for the genocide of European Roma during the Nazi period. It means \"swallowing whole,\" \"destroyed\" or \"devoured.\" It is estimated that up to 500,000 Sinti and Roma right across Europe were murdered by the Nazis and their allies during World War II.InRomaniaitself, one of German leader Adolf Hitler's allies, Ion Antonescu, had over 25,000 Roma deported from Romania to Transnistria. They were described as \"asocial\" or \"nomadic\" and sent off in freight wagons without food or water.Many died from hunger, disease or the results of violence.\"But these 25,000 victims of the Holocaust don't seem to have been enough [for some people],\" said Nicolae Paun, one of the only Roma politicians in the Romanian parliament.

On social media platform X, Ben-Gvir said that 80 years after the Holocaust, Germany was once again supporting Nazis.Before he left Germany, Wadephul had warned that Israel was becoming increasingly isolated internationally. He also said Berlin would respond to any unilateral actions by Israel and was critical of potential Israeli plans to annex the occupied West Bank.Israel's Saar answered Ben-Gvir on social media too. \"I strongly reject Minister Ben-Gvir's statements about Germany.

Over this weekend, he is to report back to the Chancellor and the security cabinet.The results of this are hard to predict.

The country's new Economy Minister Katherina Reiche wants Germans to work longer to make up for it.https://p.dw.com/p/4yHeBIn 2025, two-thirds of the Labor Ministry's budget will go into propping up the pension systemImage: Svetlana/Zoonar/picture allianceAdvertisementFor German Economy MinisterKatherina Reiche, there's a simple way to fix Germany's pension system: \"We need to work more and longer,\" she flatly told theFrankfurter Allgemeine Zeitungnewspaper in late July, instantly triggering a new debate along familiar lines. Reiche argued that the pledges her government had made in the coalition contract earlier this year were just not going to be enough.Germany's aging population has long been recognized as a problem. The population's median age — 46.7 — is the eighth-highest in the world and the third-highest among major economies, after Japan and Italy. By 2040, fully a quarter of the population is expected to be 67 or older. This year,birth rate fell to its lowest point in 20 years.This has had a marked effect: In the early 1960s, there were still six actively insured workers for every pensioner — that ratio is now 2 to 1 and sinking, and in 2025, two-thirds of the Labor Ministry's budget will go into the pension system: €121 billion ($140 billion).\"It cannot be sustainable in the long term for us to work only two-thirds of our adult lives and spend one-third in retirement,\" said Reiche. \"Unfortunately, too many people have been refusing to accept the demographic reality for too long.\"Economy Minister Katherina Reiche has suggested raising Germany's retirement ageImage: Odd Andersen/AFP/Getty ImagesReiche's statements triggered a quick backlash from her center-left Cabinet colleagues. Lars Klingbeil, finance minister and leader of theSocial Democratic Party(SPD), which traditionally sees itself catering to a working-class electorate, described Reiche's statement as a \"slap in the face\" for many workers.\"It's easy to say that when you're sitting in your comfortable chair in Berlin,\" Klingbeil told news outlet ntv. \"But you should go out and talk to the people in the country who are working as roofers, who are working as nurses, who are working as teachers and are really wearing themselves out and who are already struggling to make it to 67.\"Trade unions, meanwhile, said Reiche's plan was simply a new way to cut pensions. Many workers will be unable to work to a higher age for health reasons, forcing them to retire early, and accept deductions that permanently reduce their pensions.Raising retirement age doesn't rule out pension cutsThe contract agreed by Germany's two governing parties — Reiche's conservativeChristian Democratic Union(CDU) and the SPD — promised that Germany's current retirement age would not be raised.Instead, the contract pledged, \"We want more flexibility in the transition from job to pension.\" In practice, \"flexibility\" means offering incentives to people who work beyond the legal retirement age. This would include measures like the so-called \"Aktivrente\" (\"active pension\"), by which any income of up to €2,000 per month is tax-free for those above the legal retirement age.Jan Scharpenberg, pensions expert at the financial advice company Finanztip, is convinced that the German pension system urgently needs to be reformed, but that the debate around it has become tedious.\"The length of a working life is just one of the levers that can be adjusted to reform the German pension system in order to deal with the demographic transformation,\" he told DW. \"And if I'm being really honest, I think it's a bit exhausting how for years and decades the same pro- and con arguments are being made, but no actual reform is put in place.\"While he agrees that raising the legal retirement age may become necessary, that doesn't negate the argument that it would, in practical terms, mean pension cuts for some people. \"Those two things can be true at the same time, but that shouldn't prevent a pension reform,\" he said. \"A reform of the system will only work if you combine and pull several levers.\"How Germany's pension system worksThe retirement age system in Germany is dauntingly complicated. At the moment, the legal retirement age in Germany is 65, though it is scheduled to rise to 67 by 2031. But the age is staggered depending on the individual's year of birth, and how long they have paid into the system.And there are exceptions: People who are disabled or have paid into the system for 45 years, for example, can retire earlier.A contribution of 18.6% of an employee's gross monthly salary goes into the state retirement fund, with the employee and the employer each paying half. The government expects this contribution rate to rise to 22.3% by 2035, where it is supposed to level out until 2045.Johannes Geyer, public economics resea"

Both have seen a sharp uptick in attacks since theIsrael-Hamas conflicterupted nearly two years ago. Even with a split on thestatehood recognition, both faiths also worry their fraying ties may further erode.\"The war has ended many relationships, both among leaders and among the population,\" Gerard Unger, vice president of the Representative Council of French Jewish Institutions (CRIF), told DW. \"The two sides hardly speak anymore. Each side is aware that if they do, each will declare it's a victim.\"The CRIF is among those blasting Macron's declaration, alongside French conservative and far-right politicians.

He noted that the French president earlier set still-unmet conditions for recognizing Palestinian statehood, including the release of Israeli hostages and the \"demilitarization\" ofHamas, an Islamist militant group which Israel, theEuropean Union, theUnited Statesand others have designated as a terrorist organization. \"That explains the Jewish community's anger and disappointment.\"Other prominent Jewish figures are also sharply critical. \"It's an opportunistic decision,\" lawyer Arno Klarsfeld, son of famous Nazi hunter Serge Klarsfeld, told France's conservative CNews TV. \"It cements the divorce with the Jewish community in France, considerably chills relations with Israel and the United States and reinforces Hamas.\"Not surprisingly, many of France's Muslim leaders and leftist parties have broadly saluted the president's move.\"Mr. Macron's decision has been received with great satisfaction and joy,\" said Abdallah Zekri, vice president of the French Council of the Muslim Faith. \"We hope it will translate to reality in September, without any preconditions.\"France makes U-turn on Gaza conflictFew dispute that Macron's statehood declaration marks a diplomatic U-turn. Two weeks after the Hamas-led attacks against Israel on October 7, 2023, the French president was in Jerusalem pledging \"unconditional support\" for Israel, calling for an international coalition to fight Hamas. Last year, he led a ceremony for French victims of the Hamas assault, calling it \"the largestantisemiticattack of our century.\"But Macron reportedly has been shaken byGaza's escalating humanitarian crisisand Israel's ongoing military campaign. The conflict in Gaza has killed more than 62,000 people, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in the enclave, and many currently suffer from widespread famine.In June, France shut down several Israeli weapons stands at the Paris Air Show for refusing to remove attack arms in their display,sparking Israeli fury.Then came Macron's announced intention to recognize Palestinian statehood, a move Israeli Prime MinisterBenjamin Netanyahucriticized by saying it \"rewards terror.\" Undeterred, France, along withSaudi Arabia, co-hosted a UN conference in New York on July 28 calling for a two-state solution.France first G7 country to recognize Palestinian statehoodTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 videoHow the French public feels about Palestinian statehoodPolls suggest that a majority of French people support the idea. But"

Their first employees were Joseph Heerich, a German-born potter, and Julius Albus Jr., a 12-year-old boy who did odd jobs. Both would spend the rest of their careers there, a pattern other employees would repeat over the years.When looking for a company name, Perry picked \"Pewabic,\" the name of a copper mine near her Michigan birthplace. The word comes from the Chippewa, or Ojibwa, language and means either \"metal\" or, more specifically, \"iron.\"A mural shows Pewabic co-founder Mary Chase Perry working at a pottery wheel in the early days of the potteryImage: Timothy Rooks/DWThe pottery started producing lamp bases, vases, planters, cups, bowls and tabletop cigarette boxes. Tile production came a little later and would eventually prove to be an essential source of income. These tiles were used as ordinary floor coverings or eye-catching architectural accents like fireplace surrounds or friezes.The growing business soon needed more space, so a custom-built factory opened in 1907. It is a half-timbered building that doesn't look like a traditional workshop. And despite the challenges of working in Detroit during turbulent times, Pewabic hasn't budged. It expanded the facility in 1911 and 2018.It's all in the glazeAt a time when women didn't run many businesses, Mary Chase Perry was good at selling and not afraid to take on large-scale projects. Pewabic's co-founders combined art, technology and entrepreneurship.This allowed them to experiment and create new, iridescent glazes — each attempt meticulously recorded in notebooks — and those glazes allowed Perry to \"paint with fire,\" as she often said.Tiles are still pressed into plaster molds while many vases, bowls and cups are shaped on a spinning potter's wheelImage: Timothy Rooks/DWPewabic set itself apart through its nearly 600 glazes. These glazes plus creative firing techniques led to unexpected colors and textures. Many pieces had a crackle effect that was smooth to the touch. Other times, the glaze melted and flowed down the sides, making it more tangible to the touch.Pewabic tiles are found in homes, libraries, schools, fountains, churches and public buildings across the country. Its vases are in museums like theMetropolitan Museum of Artin New York City and theSmithsonianin Washington D.C.Made of more than just clayAs Detroit's fortunes ebbed and flowed so did Pewabic's.The Great Depression andWWIIhad a big impact on the workforce and their output as people scaled back spending. The business suffered more when people stopped building big homes or left the city altogether. Later Detroit went into a steep decline and its population dropped by two-thirds from its 1950 peak.Each item is fired twice in one of its big natural gas-powered kilns. Pieces that get an iridescent glaze require an additional firingImage: Timothy Rooks/DWWhile the world changed around them, Pewabic clung to their traditional ways.They kept making clay with the same belt-driven mixer and filter press first installed in 1912. They still pressed their tiles into molds by hand. Vessels, a general term for vases, bowls and cups, were still hand-thrown on a wheel or slip cast, which means pouring liquid clay into a plater mold.Breaking and keeping the moldsToday, around 50 employees work at Pewabic. Sixteen of them are artisans, and four work on the design team. The rest are in education, retail or administration.The workshop has three big gas-powered kilns, big enough to walk in. Exposed shelves are tightly stacked with tiles and objects ready to fire, which usually happens overnight three times a week.The next room is where they mix the"

They are tales of human weakness, of anguish and longing, but also beauty.The writer's children's stories are his greatest legacy, and the Hans Christian Andersen Award is the highest international recognition given to an author and illustrator of children's books.Here are five reasons why Hans Christian Andersen remains relevant 150 years after his death.Hans Christian Andersen has been immortalized in his hometown of CopenhagenImage: Ida Marie Odgaard/Ritzau Scanpix/picture alliance1. From childhood struggles to feted artistBorn on April 2, 1805, Andersen grew up in humble circumstances in Odense, a town in southern Denmark. His father was a cobbler, his mother a laundress and alcoholic. His aunt ran a brothel.During Andersen's childhood, his family's struggled to put food on the table, and he attended a local school for impoverished children. It was there that he discovered his love for books and the theater and began to write his first stories.At the age of 14, he went to Copenhagen and met the director of the Royal Danish Theater, who took Andersen under his wing and nurtured his talent. By the time the writer turned 30, the whole of Europe was captivated by his poems, plays, two novels and the first volume of \"Fairy Tales Told for Children.\"But recognition eluded him back home inDenmark, where critics derided his fairy tales as \"harmful\" and \"irresponsible.\"Nonetheless, Andersen's mythical tales underpinned his global fame and Denmark ultimately celebrated his talent as he received patronage and travel grants from the Danish king.2. Subtle social criticism to protests against injusticeLook behind thefairy talesheen of Andersen's stories and you'll often find subtle satire or veiled criticism of power, vanity and social injustice.\"The Emperor's New Clothes\" is a parable about vanity and the fear of contradicting authority — a theme that's more relevant than ever in the social media age.Few children's tales are as poignant as the story of the little girl trying to sell matches on a freezing cold New Year's Eve. The next day she's found on the street, frozen to death and nameless.Andersen didn't just write \"The Little Match Girl\" to make us feel something. It's also intended as a social critique, a silent protest against indifference to poverty and child suffering.\"The Ugly Duckling,\" often interpreted as autobiographical, relates the success story of a humiliated outsider, the life of a misunderstood chick that, despite numerous setbacks, finally fulfills its dream and transforms into a beautiful swan. As Hans Christian Andersen once said: \"It doesn't matter if you're born in a duck yard, so long as you're hatched from a swan's egg!\"One of the earliest versions of 'The Ugly Duckling' featured illustrations by Vilhelm PedersenImage: Public domain\"The Little Mermaid\" is a metaphor for the longing for another world and the willingness to sacrifice one's self for love. The main protagonist in this story falls in love with a prince and sacrifices her voice to be with him as a human being. But he marries someone else. In the end, she dissolves into the sea and becomes a \"daughter of the air,\" granted the opportunity to earn an immortal soul through good deeds.The stories tune into emotions familiar to people regardless of where in the world they are: the search for love and identity, the hope of recognition, the power of personal transformation. And the fact that life doesn't always give us happy endings. These messages are timeless.3. A life marked by fear and eccentricityAndersen was a colorful character, highly sensitive and at the same time full of idiosyncrasies. He suffered from paranoia, mood swings and hypochondria. He was afraid of dogs and robberies. When he received a bad review, he would roll around on the floor in a rage. When traveling, he always carried a rope with him so that he could abseil out of burning hotels in an emergency.The 'Frozen' film franchise was inspired by Andersen's story, 'The Snow Queen'Image: Disney/dpa/picture allianceAndersen also suffered from a pronounced fear of being buried alive, also known as taphephobia. Fearing that he might be mistaken for dead when he slept, he left notes on his bedside table with the words: \"I only a"

Olympian Laura Dahlmeier's fatal mountain accident in Pakistan proved once again that the dangers of mountaineering are increasing.https://p.dw.com/p/4yMz9Conditions for climbers and mountaineers in Karakorum, Pakistan are becoming increasingly difficultImage: Michal Knitl/imageBROKER/IMAGOAdvertisementCould mountaineerLaura Dahlmeier still be aliveif it weren't for climate change? Of course, any answer to this is speculative. But it cannot be denied that ever-increasing temperatures have also taken their toll on the mountain in Pakistan where the formerGermanbiathlon star had her fatal accident. Falling rocks, such as those that caused Dahlmeier's death, are becoming increasingly common on the mountains in the region.The 6,096 meter (20,000 feet) high Laila Peak in the Karakoram is an eye-catcher. Its shape is reminiscent of a shark's tooth jutting into the sky. The mountain is steep on all sides and challenging from a mountaineering point of view. When the author of this article passed this mountain 20 years ago, its north-west face was still covered in a thick layer of snow.This attracted not only mountaineers, but also extreme skiers who tried their hand at descending this steep face. Now though, there is only a thin layer of snow in some places on this mountain flank, while large areas are now bare rock.Before this year'sclimbing season, which began in July, the usual precipitation had failed to materialize. In addition, very high temperatures accelerated the melting of the snow. In the small town of Chilas, located at 1265 meters above sea level on the southern edge of the Karakoram, the thermometer rose to a record 48.5 degrees Celsius (119 Farenheit) in July.Up to altitudes of over 5,500 meters, it rained instead of snowing, and there was not even a night frost in some places. Mountaineers reported unusually warm and dry conditions on the country's mountains up to over 8,000 meters.Snow and ice are normally a kind of natural glue that ensures that boulders stay in place. If the snow melts, the risk of rockfall and wet snow avalanches increases. Some expeditions left the Karakoram prematurely this summer without reaching the summit. The verdict: too dangerous.Expeditions must change their schedules\"I believe that in future, expeditions will have to get to Pakistan earlier -because of climate change, which is very clearly noticeable there,” says experienced German mountaineer David Göttler. \"I think that's inevitable.”Göttler climbed the 8,125-metre-high Nanga Parbat at the end of June - in alpine style, i.e. without bottled oxygen, permanently installed ropes, fixed high camps or the support of sherpas. Together with his two team mates from France, he had previously acclimatized to the thin air on a six-thousander and a seven-thousander in Nepal.\"It's crazy how quickly these mountains are changing,\" Göttler said. \"The objective dangers are increasing, and rockfall is on the rise.\"One example is the 7,162-meter-high Baruntse, not far from Mount Everest.\"Huge crevasses open up on the summit ridge, and you have to find your way around them. It wasn't a very challenging mountain in the past,\" Göttler added. \"But now, even as a beginner, you really have to know what you are doing with your crampons on a seven-thousander like this.\"To avoid the threat of rockfall in the warm midday hours, climbers have started to set off earlier and earlier. On particularly vulnerable mountains, climbers have turned to climbing at night and resting during the day.Heavy rainfall, dam collapses at glacial lakesExtreme weather events caused byclimate changeare also increasing on the highest mountains. In the Karakoram, several concrete bridges over rivers were literally washed away after heavy rainfall a week and a half ago. This meant that expeditions had to take alternate routes on their arrival and departure. At least 18 people died.A broken bridge in the north of Pakistan near ChilasImage: Hussain Ali/ZUMA/IMAGOInNepal, floodwaters destroyed a bridge over a border river to Tibet in July.

Not those who worked for East Germany's Ministry for State Security (Stasi). A new book reveals the mundane lives of the agents.https://p.dw.com/p/4yMTkNot quite James Bond technology: The Stasi spied on millions of East German citizens, for example from mobile observation units like this oneImage: BArch, MfS, HA II, Nr. 40000, S. 20, Bild 2Advertisement\"Comrades, we must know everything!\": Erich Mielke's message was clear. As director of East Germany's Ministry for State Security (commonly known as theStasi) from 1957 to 1989, he oversaw the systematic surveillance of its citizens.Stasi informants could potentially be found anywhere, even among colleagues or friends. Their task was to detect people labeled as \"harmful\" to society. In the eyes of theGerman Democratic Republic (GDR)regime, this included anyone who criticized the system and cooperated with the so-called \"class enemy.\"This reasoning legitimized the construction of theBerlin Wallin 1961, which the GDR called the \"anti-fascist protection barrier\" against the \"imperialist\" or \"fascist\" capitalists in the West.Stasi methods: Surveillance and intimidationTo the GDR, the enemy was everywhere. For the Stasi secret police, which was founded in 1950, anything could arouse suspicion: From a joke about the chairman of the State Council, to listening to non-conformist music, to receiving letters with stamps from the West, or asking for a visitor's permit to enter West Germany.As \"the shield and sword of the party,\" the Stasi was in charge of maintaining the rule of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) by clamping down on any opposition.Stasi officials wouldspyon people by reading their mail, wiretapping their calls and illegally entering their apartments. They would intimidate people and spread rumors — that they were alcoholic, or gay, for instance — to discredit them.In an especially deceitful move, agents would sometimes even spread lies about someone working for the Stasi. Many GDR citizens were imprisoned after criticizing the regime.Stasi HQ in Berlin: East Germany's secret service at workTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 videoWhy people worked for the StasiColloquially, the Stasi was known as \"Die Firma\" (The Company) or \"Horch und Greif\" (\"Listen and Nab\"). Around 90,000 people worked for the Stasi full-time, while 100,000-200,000 \"informal collaborators\" (depending on the source) worked as informants before November 1989 when the Berlin Wall fell.These unofficial informants would spy on their friends and family — either willingly, or because they themselves were put under pressure.But what made them work for the authoritarian regime?That depends, said historian Philipp Springer, whose book, \"Die Hauptamtlichen\" (\"Staffing the Stasi\") was published in July in Germany.\"One reason was the feeling of having power over your fellow citizens,\" Springer explained of motivations for joining the Stasi. \"And then there were the promises made by the ministry, which would claim that the job was interesting and might even allow for deployments abroad. At the end of the day, it was a very secure job to have — especially for people struggling with their career prospects.\"'Less exciting that you might imagine'When researching his book, the author rediscovered rare photographs of Stasi officials at work from the Stasi Records Archive.As spies and informants, Stasi employees were usually behind the camera, not in front. Looking at the photos, the promise of an exciting life as a secret service agent quickly fades.\"There might have been a few aspects of aJames Bondlife if you were deployed abroad and were involved in espionage,\" said Springer. \"[But] if you weren't directly involved in espionage, then most of it was a lot less exciting that you might imagine.\"The former headquarters of the Stasi is now a museum that exhibits the mundane routine of spy workImage: Hannibal Hanschke/dpa/picture allianceThat's also why the photos in the book seem somewhat dull and amateurish: a man standing at a copying machine, for instance, or another man sitting at his desk. A woman working in the kitchen, or sometimes, just a hand reaching for the index card box.\"Of course, these are all pretty normal things to see and are not really exciting,\" said Springer. \"But at the end of the day, all these Stasi employees helped to keep the state apparatus going. They were all part of the system and had been trained politically and ideologically … they were defending the socialist GDR against the West.\"'Tiny clog in this huge machine'The author tried to include the biographies of some subjects in the photos, including first lieutenant Elfi-Elke Mertens, whose father had already worked for the Stasi — as did her husband.

His government is using the recognition of a Palestinian state as a means of political pressure to push forward the so-called two-state solution.What is meant by the two-state solution?To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 videoUntil now, the UK has delayed its recognition of aPalestinian statein part because of the country's own historical responsibility. Between 1920 and 1948, Britain was the administrative power in Palestine, which had previously been part of the Ottoman Empire.In 1917, the British government issued a statement — the Balfour Declaration, named after then-British Foreign Minister Arthur Balfour — that said it supported the idea of a \"national home for the Jewish people\" in Palestine. The declaration was made without considering the rights of the Arab majority population there and the move went on to spark violence between local Arabs, immigrant Jews and the British administration.Two years after David Ben-Gurion, the first prime minister of Israel, announced the establishment of the State of Israel,Britainrecognized the country. But when it came to recognizing Palestine as a state, the UK regularly said that this had to be part of a peace deal. This was also strategic: Britain didn't want to jeopardize its relationships with the US or Israel.The Balfour Declaration, named after then-British Foreign Minister Arthur J. Balfour (above) supported the idea of a 'national home for the Jewish people' in PalestineImage: akg-images/picture allianceBut this historical position has come under ever more pressure. The ongoing conflict in Gaza — fighting there began in October 2023 after an attack on Israel by the Gaza-based militant group Hamas, that resulted in the deaths of around 1,200 people and the kidnapping of 251 — has sowed serious internal divisions in the UK.In cities like London, Manchester and Glasgow, protesters regularly take to the streets in huge demonstrations calling for an end to the current conflict and Israeli occupation.Labour Party supporters favor Palestinian stateThese popular protests are supported by many local trade unions as well as left-leaning political organizations, such as the Palestine Solidarity Campaign and the Stop the War group (the latter also opposes Europeans fighting in Ukraine).Former Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn has also called for an end to weapons deliveries to Israel. In late July, Corbyn announced he was starting his own political party \"to take on the rich and powerful.\" Corbyn was suspended from the Labour Party in 2020 after he said a report intoantisemitisminside the party under his leadership had been exaggerated for \"political reasons by our opponents inside and outside the party, as well as by much of the media.\"According to aYouGov surveyundertaken on 24-25 July, around two-thirds of Labour supporters agree with the UK government's decision to recognize Palestine. Of the general public, the YouGov poll found that 45% think it's a good idea.In the British Parliament, 221 members have signed a letter calling for recognition of Palestine. Among the signatories were many Labour Party members. Ministers in Starmer's cabinet have also pushed in this direction.Protests against Israeli military actions have regularly taken place in London and other cities across the UKImage: Vuk Valcic/ZUMA Press Wire/IMAGOStarmer appears to have given in to the pressure, at least partially.

They don't care where the patient buys the drug,\" said Saifuddin Ahmed, a public health practitioner and epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University in the US.\"It is critically important that a health care provider should be engaged. The [regulators are] not enough,\" Ahmed told DW.Nowhere else is the challenge more obvious than with the huge demand for products like Wegovy and Zepbound.They contain active compounds called semaglutide or tirzepatide, which were originally designed to treat type 2diabetes. But these drugs were found to have a side effect that triggeredsubstantial, sustained weight loss.Demand rose from people wanting to lose weight, and that caused a shortage. Fakes have filled the gap.Fake drugs are a global problemDrug counterfeiting is a major global problem. TheWorld Health Organization (WHO)estimates that one in 10 pharmaceuticals are fakes that carry no guarantee of any health benefits.While this is mainly a problem in low-and-middle income countries, especially parts of Africa and Asia, around 1% of people in high-income nations also obtainmedicationfrom unregulated sources.In some cases, these drugs may have no effect. In other cases, however, ingredients in the fake medication may lead toadverse reactionsor create new health problems.\"Purchasing medicine online from unregulated, unlicensed sources can expose patients to potentially unsafe products that have not undergone appropriate evaluation or approval, or do not meet quality standards,\" said theUSregulator, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2023, when it issued its first warnings about the problem.In 2024, the WHO issued a global warning that batches of fake Ozempic wereflooding the black market.More recently, in July 2025, data from the UK National Pharmacy Association found one in five Britons had attempted to obtain weight loss treatments in the previous year.It warned that the high demand for these medicines carried the risk that people would \"resort to unregulated online suppliers instead of regulated pharmacies.\"There is global demand for semaglutide and tirzepatide, but costs and supplies mean consumers may look to unregulated sourcesImage: Oliver Berg/dpa/picture allianceWhere are people buying counterfeit medicine?Unregulated pharmaceuticals are being sold via online-only pharmacies, international drug shopping and organized criminal distributors.These digital marketplaces are not online stores for established pharmacies, but sites that seemingly offer medicine at a fraction of the usual cost.The drugs may look identical to genuine medicines online, but when delivered often have spelling errors on the packet or incorrect ingredient listings.But it's not only fake drugs or placebos. Regulators have raised concern about compounding, where medicines that have been approved individually can be formulated to produce non-regulated \"compounds\" for individual patients.In some regions of the world, including the US, trained pharmacists are allowed to compound medicines, but even then, the practice is less regulated than the stringent approvals that drug manufacturers must meet to bring their products to market.For example, when the FDA temporarily allowed the compounding of weight loss drugs to address a product shortage, some pharmacists used semaglutide salts — which are not approved by regulators — instead of semaglutide itself. This led to reports of side effects.And it wasn't just trained compounding pharmacies that were formulating these products in the US. Ahmed said, \"this is done in [places] like gymnasiums and spas.\"The FDA has now stopped allowing compounded versions of these weight loss drugs, but it is concerned that unregulated online pharmacies are still making substandard products available.Weight loss injectionTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 videoRaising awareness about fake drugsTo address concerns that consumers may seek unsafe products from unregulated sources, the FDA operates a campaign calledBeSafeRxthat provides guidance for consumers to identify genuine pharmaceuticals.In the European Union, safety features on medicines are mandated, and include standardized labeling practices.

Costs are spiraling and criticism of the planning and implementation is growing.https://p.dw.com/p/4yFwrThe Deutsche Bahn route from Berlin to Hamburg is billed as the fast track 'Schnellfahrstrecke'Image: Soeren Stache/dpa/picture allianceAdvertisementStarting August 1,Deutsche Bahn's 280-kilometer (174-mile) route linkingBerlintoHamburgwill be completelyclosed for at least nine months. With up to 30,000 passengers daily, it is the most heavily used direct connection in Germany's long-distance railtransport. Around 230 regional, long-distance and freight trains travel daily on the tracks between Germany's two largest cities.Starting Friday, the intercity passenger trains will have to take a 100-kilometer detour, while freight trains will be rerouted even further. In addition, 170 buses will be deployed daily to continue connecting the towns between Berlin and Hamburg that will be cut off from rail service. Both the construction work and the replacement transport will be complex and potentially prone to disruption.Deutsche Bahn: Dilapidated infrastructure, decades of neglectOn Thursday, Deutsche Bahn reported a loss of €760 million for the first half of the year. The company billed this as progress, as losses had been reduced by almost €1 billion compared to the previous year.\"Deutsche Bahn is facing its biggest crisis in 30 years,\" CEO Richard Lutz admitted in May. \"We cannot ensure stable operations on a fault-prone and outdated infrastructure.\"World's first hydrogen train runs in GermanyTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 videoGermany's national rail network covers around 33,500 kilometers (20,800 miles) of tracks. As a state-owned company, the operator Deutsche Bahn is dependent on subsidies from the federal government, which critics say has invested far too little in infrastructure over the last few decades.In fact, some tracks, junctures and even signal boxes date back to the 19th century. Many systems are completely worn out, almost beyond repair, and now so outdated that they are unusable for digitally controlled rail operations, which are to become standard.There is no way around completely rebuilding them. The\"general renovation\" projectbegan in 2024, with a focus on 41 main lines, which have a combined length of 4,200 kilometers and are essential for the operation.Deutsche Bahn's biggest overhaulThe 70-kilometer line between Frankfurt am Main and Mannheim was the first to be revamped. It was completely closed for six months as tracks and overhead lines were torn out and reinstalled.The 20 stations along the route, the signaling technology and the sound insulation were also renewed. However, installation of digital technology turned out to be more complicated than expected. Construction costs rose to more than €1.5 billion ($1.73 billion) — twice as much as anticipated.The Federal Audit Office, which monitors the government's budget management, subsequently accused the Federal Transport Ministry of negligence, arguing that Deutsche Bahn should have been required to prove the economic viability of its actions.Further renovation funds should only be made available once the Transport Ministry has \"proven beyond doubt that they were necessary and economical,\" the office said.This led Deutsche Bahn to announce that the general renovation would be extended by six years until 2036.The company has now significantly scaled back its original construction plans. The number of new passing tracks and switches — which ensure that fast trains can overtake slow ones — has been reduced.The installation of the European Train Control System (ETCS) has been postponed until the next decade.The government has pledged additional funds to renovate the rail network, with Transport Minister Patrick Schnieder promising rail infrastructure investments totaling €107 billion by 2029. Most of the money is to come from the debt-financed special fund for infrastructure and climate protection launched at the beginning of the year.How to travel by train in GermanyTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 videoDelays cost millionsCurrently,only 62% of German trains are considered to be on time— that is, those that arrive within six minutes of their scheduled time.

The conviction is the first of anyone tried over the high-profile execution.What did the Stockholm court say?\"The investigation has shown that the defendant was at the execution site, uniformed and armed, and allowed himself to be filmed,\" Judge Anna Liljenberg Gullesjo said in a statement.Though video evidence showed another man lighting the fire that killed the pilot, the judge said K.'s involvement was decisive: \"Defendant's actions contributed so significantly to the death of the victim that he should be considered a perpetrator.\"K., who wascharged in May, is already serving sentences for his role in the2015 Parisand 2016 Brussels terror attacks. He was convicted of \"serious war crimes and terrorist crimes\" for helping facilitate the execution, which was widely condemned at the time for its brutality.The pilot had been captured by IS fighters after his Royal Jordanian Air Force plane went down in Syria on December 24, 2014. He was burned alive in a cage, with the video of the killing released publicly on February 3, 2015.Liljenberg Gullesjo said K. was responsible for \"guarding the victim both before and during the execution and taking him to the cage where he was set alight while still alive.\"Images of the death were disseminated online by the jihadi group.How does IS keep recruiting people — and who are they?To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 videoThe court also ordered compensation to be paid to the pilot's parents and siblings, awarding 80,000 Swedish kronor (about €7,200 or $8,200) each.What more do we know about the court case?The 32-year-old Swedish citizen Osama K. comes from the Swedish city of Malmo.Investigators were unable to work out the exact day of the murder, but the probe did identify the location where it took place.The defendant's lawyer, Petra Eklund, had argued that her client admitted to being present at the scene but disputed the allegation.What were Osama K.'s other convictions?K. joined IS in Syria in 2014 and later returned to Europe, prosecutors said. In 2022, he was sentenced inFranceto 30 years in prison for complicity in the November 2015 Paris attacks that left 130 dead.In 2023, he was given a life sentence inBelgiumfor his role in the 2016Brusselsattacksthat killed 32 people.France agreed on March 12 to hand over K. to Sweden for nine months to allow for investigation and trial. He will be returned to France afterward to continue serving his sentence.Editor's note: In an effort to limit their exposure, Deutsche Welle has decided to withhold terror suspects' names and obscure their faces.Edited by Sean SinicoRichard ConnorReporting on stories from around the world, with a particular focus on Europe — especially Germany.Send us your feedbackYour feedbackAdvertisement"

And further cuts are planned. Aid organizations warn of the consequences.https://p.dw.com/p/4yHu9German projects for humanitarian aid to displaced people in places like Congo must continue, according to NGOsImage: Cunningham/Getty ImagesAdvertisementGermany's cuts to its development spending will be a serious blow to aid organizations.\"We are deeply concerned. And it will be felt by people in theGlobal South,\" said Oliver Müller, head of Caritas International, which is involved in emergency and disaster relief worldwide.Müller is appalled at the draft of Germany's 2026 federal budget, which the federal government approved on Wednesday.According to the draft, the budget of the Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development will fall below the €10 billion ($11.4 billion) mark for the first time since 2018. The budget had already shrunk by almost €1 billion from 2024 to 2025.What Müller finds equally alarming is that the Foreign Office's budget for humanitarian emergency aid is set to be cut by more than half by 2026.Caritas has been able to fund several large projects thanks to government money, \"but these projects will be eliminated without replacement,\" Müller said.How Germany's cuts in foreign aid could cost livesTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 videoMüller emphasized that Caritas International won't be making across-the-board cuts.\"There simply are humanitarian crises that we think are so serious and terrible that we will continue to use our own funds, donations and church funds to provide assistance,\" he said.As an example, Müller pointed to aid for internally displaced people in the easternDemocratic Republic of Congo, \"one of the greatest humanitarian disasters of our time.\" The Foreign Ministry will no longer provide any more funding for Congo.\"In the worst case, no one will provide any more help,\" he added.Currently, there is a trend to cut back on aid for the world's poorest, said Müller, pointing to cuts made by the United States, as well as the United Kingdom, Belgium and other EU countries.Germany's credibility on the lineOther organizations have widely criticized the German federal government's planned cuts. VENRO, an umbrella organization for development cooperation and humanitarian aid organizations, warned Germany not to \"shirk its responsibility.\"Given the expected cuts, VENRO said it would no longer be possible to engage in strategic international cooperation. It accused the government of overlooking the importance of the work done by the networks of professional organizations from civil society and those on the ground in providing emergency aid. The cuts are \"absolutely incomprehensible,\" according to a VENRO statement.The day before the budget announcement, 17 aid organizations jointly accused the government of jeopardizing \"not only life-saving measures, but also Germany's strategic interests and international credibility.\" Among those who signed the statement were Bread for the World, Welthungerhilfe, One and Oxfam. A similar call had already been made in June by 30 organizations.All of this means that the ministry headed by Reem Alabali Radovan, who has been in office since May, is losing its ability to make a difference. The declining importance of development policy is also evident when looking at the overall budget. The draft budget for 2026 provides for expenditures of €520.5 billion, around a third of which is currently still financed by new loans.Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil explained that the aim was to ensure Germany's future viability, stressing the growing importance of military readiness to counter Russia's aggressive warfare. Without Russian PresidentVladimir Putin, this budget would look very different, said the SPD politician, who is also vice chancellor in the coalition government made up of Klingbeil'sSocial Democrats(SPD) and theChristian Democrats(CDU/CSU).What the end of USAID means — Global UsTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 videoOf the planned total budget, €9.94 billion has been allocated to the the Development Aid Ministry — just over 1.9% of the national budget.

The American social psychologist argues that smartphone-based childhoods and social media are helping to fuel anepidemic of mental illnessamong teenagers.As the ban was passed in the Australian Parliament in November 2024, one poll revealed overwhelming support among 77% of Australians. The plan to fine TikTok,Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X, Instagram andnow YouTube, 49.5 million Australian dollars (€27.7 million, $32.3 million) for failing to block young people was supported by 87% of those surveyed. Underage social media users and their parents will not be punished for any violations under the law.Social media companies, includingElon Musk's X, were predictablyunimpressedwith a ban that many concede will also be difficult to police.\"It's entirely likely the ban could see young people pushed to darker corners of the internet where no community guidelines, safety tools or protections exist,\" said aTikTokspokesperson when the bill was passed.The Australian social media ban partly seeks to protect young people from thecyberbullying,disinformationand illegal content that has riddled social media platforms. But some experts doubt whether prohibition is an antidote to deteriorating youth mental health.Should kids be banned from social media?To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 videoCan a 'nice, simple solution' solve a complex crisis?Marilyn Campbell, a professor in the School of Early Childhood and Inclusive Education at the Queensland University of Technology who writes on cyberbullying, warns that little research establishes a \"causal\" connection between social media and psychological health.\"We know that there's a high correlation between the rise of new technologies and the increase in young people's poorer mental health,\" she said. \"But we don't even know why yet.\"One 2023 study sampling social media use in 72 countries found \"no evidence suggesting that the global penetration of social media is associated with widespread psychological harm.\"Campbell noted that though populist psychology works like \"The Anxious Generation\" merely draw a correlation between rising youth anxiety and depression andsocial media use, they have been heavily hyped in the media. Building on the popularity of these ideas, the government is now pursuing a \"nice, simple solution,\" she told DW.\"You don't have to spend any money on it,\" she said of the ban. \"It's not complicated.\"Researchers at the University of Queenslandnotethat the limited understanding of how social media impacts young people's mental health means other influences need to be considered, such as rising \"social inequity,\" \"climate anxiety\" and \"gendered violence.\"Are social media platforms a primary source of growing youth depression and anxiety?Image: William West/AFP/Getty ImagesCampbell suggested that instead of focusing on social media, governments need to \"reform the mental health system,\" adding that \"many more school counselors and school psychologists\" would help.\"There are lots of things that they could do but that cost money,\" she added.Can social media also help young people?The Australian government continues to conflate social media use and the psychological struggles of young people.\"We know that social media is doing social harm, and my government and this parliament is prepared to take action to protect young Australians,\" said Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Wednesday when announcing thatYouTubewould be added to the list of banned platforms after initially being excluded.But social media can also be positive for young people, said Campbell.Writing forNaturemagazine in January, she noted that young people with autism or who are \"exploring their sexual and gender identity\" can sometimes more easily identify with peers online than in person.She added that, like the prohibition of alcohol in the US, a ban just forces the problem underground.Youth also need to be prepared to live in a \"technologically-saturated world,\" the professor told DW. \"We are not doing them any favors by saying, well, you can't be in this world until you're 16.\"How will Australia enforce its under-16s social media ban?To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web"

That's because LNG production and transport emitsmore methane— a greenhouse gas far more potent than CO2, though it doesn't stay as long in the atmosphere.But EU Commission spokesperson Anna-Kaisa Itkonen told reporters on Thursday that the trade deal would only affect the next three years, while the bloc's decarbonization targets \"go way beyond\" that.\"So this will have no impact on our decarbonization targets — none whatsoever,\" she added.Can Europe keep its energy purchase promises?Still, there is skepticism about whether Europe can live up to its new pledge on US energy spending, with Aylett saying it would be \"very difficult.\"In 2024, the EU imported around€60 billion worth of oil and gas from the US.

Since 2007, this system has used over a thousand seismic sensors to detect the first, weaker P-waves (primary waves) and send alerts through phones, TV, radio, and loudspeakers, giving people critical seconds before stronger shaking begins.Japan's resilience has also been built into its cities. After the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923, building codes were strengthened, though it took some time. A major shift came in 1981, when new regulations (Shin-Taishin) required all new constructions to meet stricter seismic standards. Many essential facilities, such as hospitals and government centers, now use seismic isolation systems — engineering solutions that allow structures to sway and to absorb, rather than resist, energy.Japan’s architecture blends tradition with innovationImage: Imago Images/AFLOMiho Mazereeuw, an associate professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and director of the Urban Risk Lab, explained this approach to CNN after the 2024 Noto Peninsula earthquake: \"Conceptually, it all comes back to the idea that, rather than resisting the movement of the Earth, you let the building move with it.\"Preparedness is part of everyday life in Japan. Earthquake drills start from a young age, evacuation routes are clearly marked, and parks and schoolyards double as gathering points. The capital Tokyo alone has over 240 official evacuation sites, which are updated regularly to adapt to the city's growth.Chile: A transformation forged by experienceStretching along South America's Pacific coast,Chilealso sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire. It was the catastrophic 1960 Valdivia earthquake — that had a magnitude of 9.5, the strongest ever recorded — that reshaped the country's disaster policies. The quake and resulting tsunami caused devastation both locally and abroad.In response, Chile underwent sweeping changes. Strict building regulations requiring seismic resilience were introduced. These reforms proved their strength in 2010, when the 8.8-magnitude Maule earthquake struck and many modern buildings stood firm.The 1960 Valdivia earthquake remains the most powerful earthquake ever recordedImage: picture-alliance/United Archives/TopFotoChile's evolution extended beyond construction. Disaster management became a national effort. Institutions such as the Chilean National Disaster Prevention and Response Service (SENAPRED) were established to align risk reduction strategies across sectors, and Chile strengthened its ties with international bodies.\"We learned that there is no single solution,\" said Alicia Cebrián López, SENAPRED's national director, during a 2024 round table organized with the United Nations (UN). \"We need a combination of measures — from policy changes to capacity building—that can adapt to the specific realities of each community.\"Municipalities also play a crucial role, with community committees identifying local risks and developing action plans. Schools conduct regular earthquake drills too, embedding preparedness early into daily life.Mexico: From tragedy to awakeningMexicohas a long and painful history of earthquakes, but the country has also shown resilience. It sits atop several tectonic plates, including the Cocos and North American plates, making it highly seismic.A turning point came on September 19, 1"

Experts say the deal may have geopolitical ramifications and continue Europe's reliance on the US.https://p.dw.com/p/4yDsNCould the US-EU-trade deal favor the US over Europe? Members states are worried.Image: Marcus Brandt/dpa/picture allianceAdvertisementThough the details and effects ofthe trade dealbetween theEuropean Unionand theUnited Statesare just starting to take shape, many European business associations and politicians are already criticizing the agreement as unfair andexpressing concerns over the economic consequences.Meanwhile, Brussels emphasizes that the deal goes beyond the economy. \"It's not just about trade. It's about security. It's about Ukraine. It's about current geopolitical volatility,\" EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic in Brussels said on Monday.He told reporters that while he couldn't go into all the details of the talks between European Commission PresidentUrsula von der Leyenand US PresidentDonald Trump, he could say for sure that they were about more than just trade. For him, it is a big plus that the two biggest economies and closest allies are on the same page when it comes to the geopolitical issues of today.On Sunday, von der Leyen and Trump agreed on the terms of a deal on future tariffs. The agreement provides for a basic tariff rate of 15% on most EU imports and exemptions for certain strategically essential products, among other measures.The agreement also contains provisions of geostrategic consequence. The EU is said to have promised the US that it will purchase strategic commodities such as gas, oil, nuclear fuel and AI chips worth $750 billion (€649 billion). The EU also plans to invest a further $600 billion in the US. EU countries are also expected to purchase military equipment from the US, though whether EU members need to guarantee these purchases remains unclear.The deal has received rather muted praise from EU member states, while France and Hungary have been very critical of the European Commission.According to the EU, the deal reaches far beyond business. Observers say that the EU has not consistently leveraged its position as the world's largest single marketImage: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty ImagesWas the EU's position strong enough?Penny Naas, a policy analyst at the US-based think tank German Marshall Fund, said that the EU has not consistently leveraged its position as the world's largest single market.\"They didn't always exert their strength,\" she told DW. \"Geopolitically, Europe looked quite weak in how it conducted the negotiations and how it ultimately was given the rate coming out of this.\"Elvire Fabry, Senior Research Fellow at the Jacques Delors Institute, finds it difficult to even describe the recent talks as negotiations. She argues that the EU's hands were tied due to its dependence on security guarantees from the US. According to Fabry, the framework conditions would have been entirely different if the EU had not needed US support to help defendUkraine in its war with Russia.Trump's previous statements threatening to withdraw support from Ukraine have sent shockwaves in the EU. The bloc would unlikely be able to replace US aid financially or militarily.Both experts agree that the different interests of the member states and their lack of unity were problems during the negotiations. Fabry sees the so-called anti-coercion instrument as the only way for Europeans to apply pressure on and build credibility with the US. However, there was no agreement among the member states on its possible application.The anti-coercion instrument is designed to deter countries from exerting economic pressure on the EU. As a last resort, the EU can impose far-reaching countermeasures.Insufficient 'strategic autonomy'The agreement also has geopolitical implications for the EU. Naas observes that the commitment to buy energy, AI chips and weapons \"shows Europe's continued reliance on the US in other ways.\" Buying from the US is the \"best of bad options\" for the EU, she says, and makes it clear that Europe has not achieved strategic autonomy.French PresidentEmmanuel Macronhas coined the term \"strategic autonomy\" as a buzzword during the US-EU trade deal negotiations. This term essentially means that Europe should be as independent as possible from other powers. This independence should comprise the arms industry, energy and procuring critical raw materials.The EU agreed to buy oil and energy from the US within the new framework of the EU-US trade dealImage: Jim Thompson/Albuquerque Journal /Zuma/picture allianceEU and US against China?The deal also contains important geopolitical components with regard toChina, Fabry told DW. This is because it appears to include commitments to coordinate on issues such as Chinese overcapacity, that is, production "

Does the deal make sense?https://p.dw.com/p/4yF2NLuis Diaz is the third-most expensive signing in Bayern Munich historyImage: FC BayernAdvertisementWhat are the details of the Luis Diaz transfer?It had been rumored for some time, but theColombianwinger completed his transfer to theBundesligachampions on Wednesday. The transfer fee is thought to be €75 million ($86.5 million), making Diaz the third-most expensive player in the history of bothBayern Munichand the Bundesliga.Diaz, 28, has signed a contract, reportedly worth €275,000 a week, until 2029.\"I'm very happy, it means a lot to me to be part of FC Bayern,\" said Diaz. \"They're one of the biggest clubs in the world. I want to help my new team with my way of playing football and my character. My goal is to win every possible title, and that's what we'll work for every day as a team.\"Bayern's other major signing so far this offseason isGermany centerback Jonathan Tah, from Bundesliga rivalsBayer Leverkusen. Diaz's signing from Liverpool follows a recent trend of the German side signing big name players from England's Premier League. In 2024, they signed winger Michael Olise from Crystal Palace for €53 million and the year before that, England captain Harry Kane, for €95 million.What will Luis Diaz add to Bayern Munich?After Leroy Sane picked moving to Turkish side Galatasaray over extending his contract with Bayern, and with Serge Gnabry struggling for form and in the final year of his contract, Diaz will likely be Bayern's starting left winger, with Olise on the right.Signed byGerman coach Jürgen Klopp in 2022, Diaz is a relentless runner, with and without the ball, and became a fan favorite at Anfield during a stint that bought him a Premier League title last season. His bravery when dealing with the abduction of his parents from his hometown of Barranca, who were later returned in 2023, further endeared him to the fans.\"Luis creates a real goal threat and is a scorer, who at the same time works incredibly hard for his team. He's quick, a versatile footballer and brings an intense style of play to the game,\" said Bayern sporting director Christoph Freund of a player who has won 64 caps for his country. \"Luis Diaz represents a complete package that will thrill our fans.\"Luis Diaz is the third big Premier League arrival in three seasons, after Harry Kane (left) and Michael Olise (center)Image: Gintare Karpaviciute/REUTERSAs well as his pressing ability, Diaz is a robust player, rarely missing games through injury. That is particularly important given the injury history of Gnabry and Bayern's other wing option, Kingsley Coman. WithJamal Musiala set to miss the early part of the season, Diaz will likely see plenty of action.Was Luis Diaz Bayern Munich's main transfer target?He was not. In fact, their primary target,Florian Wirtz, joined the club Diaz has just left.Bayern was long used to hoovering up the best young German talent. Wirtz's decision to join Liverpool over Bayern has heaped pressure on Bayern's board member in charge of sport, Max Eberl, who was also reportedly keen on Atletic Bilbao's Nico Williams before the Spanish winger extended his contract instead.\"We're delighted we've been able to bring him [Diaz] to FC Bayern. Transfers like this work when every cog in the machine fits together,\" Eberl said, in a statement perhaps directed at those who have doubted his ability to land top-level players.Unlike many German players, Florian Wirtz snubbed Bayern MunichImage: Revierfoto/dpa/picture allianceThough Diaz is undoubtedly one of those, at 28 Bayern are unlikely to be able to make much profit from any future sale of Diaz, who is likely at or close to his peak. This contrasts with Wirtz (22) and Williams (23).Are Bayern Munich likely to make more signings?It seems likely. The departures of Sane andThomas Müller, though they were both on a free, have freed up a good chunk of Bayern's wage bill. Those attacking departures, plus the injury to Musiala, mean coach Vincent Kompany is still likely to want more options in attacking areas, particularly with the Champions League in mind.Stuttgart striker Nick Woltemade is another young German of the type Bayern have historically made a habit of signing, while RB Leipzig's Dutch winger Xavi Simons is also a player of interest.Bayern play Stuttgart and Leipzig in their opening two matches of the 2025-26 season, in the Super Cup on August 16 and Bundesliga on August 22, respectively.Edited by: Chuck PenfoldCorrection, July 31, 2025: An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of Luis Diaz.

But can the Vietnamese investor help rescue the island's struggling agriculture?https://p.dw.com/p/4yD44A Vietnamese farmer is still an unusual sight in the rice fields of CubaImage: Andreas KnoblochAdvertisementWith a deep rumble, the massive threshing wheel of the rice harvester pushes through the tightly packed green stalks. The plants vanish into the belly of the machine, where rice grains are separated from their husks and the straw is tossed back onto the field. A few workers watch the process from the field's edge.After a few rounds, the combine harvester moves to the side and transfers the harvested rice through a long pipe into the bed of a waiting truck — then it heads back out again.It's harvest time on the fields of Los Palacios, a sleepy small town in the southeastern part ofCuba'sPinar del Rio province.This summer, Cuban farmers harvested the first Vietnamese rice grown on their islandImage: Andreas KnoblochThe silos and an aging rice mill shimmer in the glaring sun on the horizon, and what looks like a picturesque postcard scene could prove crucial for Cuba's food security.The fields near Los Palacios belong to the Cubanacan farm, run by the state-owned enterprise Empresa Agroindustrial de Granos Los Palacios. In the wake of Fidel Castro's successful Communist revolution in 1959, all foreign landowners were expropriated.But last year, theCuban government took an unprecedented stepby granting a foreign company the right to cultivate farmland on the Communist islands.The first foreign company to be granted a lease on a stretch of farmland wasVietnameseAgri VMA, a privately heldagriculturecompany that is growing rice near Los Palacios.Cuban rice output declines amid deeper crisisStill owned by the Cuban state, the farmland lease to the Vietnamese investor is tied to a prolonged crisis in the Cuban agricultural sector caused by an overall decline in the country's economy.Fertilizers, pesticides, fuel, and spare parts are in short supply and much of the equipment is outdated or broken. In addition, a rigid system of mandatory state quotas offers little incentive for enhancing production.What's also come into play recently are environmental factors, such as soil salinization, drought, and hurricanes, which have reduced crops drivingCuban agriculture even closer to the brink of collapse.Ariel Garcia Perez oversees the pilot project for the Cuban sideImage: Andreas KnoblochAriel Garcia Perez, general director of Empresa Agroindustrial de Granos, concedes that his company is currently lacking the kind of resources needed for cultivating rice.\"I mean fertilizers, herbicides, fungicides, insecticides, and also seeds — all essential for rice production,\" he told the DW reporter out on one of the company's rice fields that were being harvested.Perez said that due to the shortages only about 6,000 hectares (14,826 acres) of rice fields are currently being cultivated, out of about 23,000 hectares that the company could cultivate in total.Rice is one of Cuba's staple foods. Last year, the country produced about 80,000 tons of rice — just over 11% of its domestic demand. Six years ago, production was more than three times higher, according to official data published by the Cuban state newspaperGranmarecently. To meet domestic consumption, Cuba has had to increase imports.Optimizeed seeds and better know howUnder efforts to spur the domestic rice output, the Cuban government has asked Vietnam for help because the two countries have maintained friendly relations for decades, intensifying especially agricultuiral cooperation in recent years.For Perez, the Los Palacios project marks a entirely new level of partnership though.Privetely owned Agri VMA is managing the lease largely independent from state interference, with operations being based on a business contract. The company has brought to Cuba its own resources, technical experts, and seeds from hybrid rice varieties developed in Vietnam.Battered by ongoing US sanctions and, more recently,the collapse of tourismduring theCOVID-19pandemic, Cuba is lacking the foreign currency reserves needed for such investments.The Vietnamese company has directly hired 40 Cuban workers for the undertaking — another first in a country where employment is typically mediated by state-run agencies.The rest of the farm workers needed are being provided by his company, says Perez. \"We, as a Cuban company, provide services to the Vietnamese company. They pay us for working the land, harvesting the rice, drying it, and milling it.\"Vietnamese agricultural scientist Tran Trong Prai brings essential knowledge to the rice fields in CubaImage: Andreas KnoblochVietnamese agricultural scientist Tran Trong Pai is one of six Vietnamese spe"

Also, in both cases, Syria's interim governmentwas unable to maintain security.Those conflicts have now extended to the Syrian community in Germany. \"People I used to be close to now seem to think we can't be friends because I'm Sunni,\" Hassan continued.Hassan's friend, Majid, isDruzeand returned from Sweida shortly before recent violence. \"I feel like people are so much more intense about this in Berlin,\" he noted. \"I think it's because some of the people here still have an old-fashioned mindset, they still act as if the [Assad] regime is in charge.\"\"Many of us in the Syrian community here have been feeling this shift,\" confirms Razan Rashidi, executive director of human rights group, The Syria Campaign, who is based in Berlin. \"In the early years of the revolution, there was a strong sense of shared struggle. People rarely asked who was Sunni, Alawite, Christian, Kurdish. We were united around opposing dictatorship and calling for freedom.\"'My only goal ever was to see the end of the regime,' Hassan, a Syrian man living in Berlin, explains, referring to Syria's dictatorial Assad regimeImage: Omar Sanadiki/AP Photo/picture allianceA Syrian brawl in GermanyBut thanks to recent events, that is changing. On July 20 in Dusseldorf, two groups of several hundred demonstrators met outside the city's main train station. One group waspro-Kurdish, the other supported the interim Syrian government.\"After initial verbal provocations, ... a fight broke out,\"the Dusseldorf police reported. Two people were arrested, one injured and bottles and stones were thrown.The same weekend, at a protest in Berlin, a small group of men in the around-400 strong crowd were heard chanting against the Druze and Israel. Berlin's mayor Kai Wegner, a member of the conservative Christian Democrats,commented on the short video clip, saying that calls for murder and terror were not acceptable in Berlin. Local police are investigating and Wegner threatened to deport the Syrians who made such statements.Syria and Israel have been at war for years and recent Israeli bombing of Syria,allegedly \"in defense\" of Syrian Druze, has heightened tensions between the Druze minority and other Syrians.There are ongoing negotiations between Syria's interim government and Syria's Kurdish, as to whether the latter give up control of northern parts of the country and join the central government and militaryImage: Delil Souleiman/AFP/Getty ImagesFor example, Ahmad, a 30-year-old waiter in Berlin, reports he recently stopped talking to a Druze friend. \"He said he wanted to buy property in Syria near the Israeli border,\" Ahmad explains. \"You just can't trust these people,\" he says angrily,referring to the minority. \"How could they do business with Israel?\" Then he dials it back. \"I don't mean all the Druze, just some,\" he later says apologetically.Most of the footage of the Berlin protest shows Syrians singing revolutionary songs. Arabic-language outlet Syria TV interviewed seven of the protesters. They all said very similar things about their motivations for being there.\"This country belongs to all of us. We must all coexist,\" one said. \"We need to stand together,\" added another.\"We organize"

Animal rights groups have filed a criminal complaint against management.https://p.dw.com/p/4yDR1Nuremberg's zoo director said the institution's baboon population had grown too large for its enclosureImage: Daniel Karmann/dpa/picture allianceAdvertisementThe Nuremberg Zoo in southernGermanykilled 12 healthy Guinea baboons on Tuesday, according to an official statement.Officials say they had no other option after they were unable to transfer animals to other zoos and contraception measures failed to slow the growth of the group.The zoo, which was closed for \"operational reasons\" on Tuesday, initially announced the plan in February 2024, noting that its troop of baboons had grown to 40 but that facilities were originally designed to house only 25 of the primates.Conflict between the animals had become more frequent in the area, resulting in injuries to individual baboons.Zoo Director Dag Encke said expanding the space was not possible, nor wasreleasing the animalsinto the wild.Rights groups decry 'irresponsible and unsustainable breeding policies'Animal rights groups harshly criticized the move and threatened to sue the institution's management, saying the problem was one of their own making.\"What we feared would happen, has,\" said the group Pro Wildlife, \"healthy animals had to be killed because the zoo maintained irresponsible and unsustainable breeding policies for decades.\"\"This culling was avoidable and illegal in our opinion,\" said the group.Pro Wildlife is one of several groups that filed a criminal complaint against the zoo for violating animal protection laws.\"Animal welfare laws permits the killing of vertebrates only if there is a reasonable cause,\" said Christoph Maisack, who heads the German Legal Association for Animal Protection Law (DJGT), adding, \"Letting them breed too freely cannot constitute such a reason.\"Zoo Director Encke defended the decision, saying management had acted in accordance with criteria set out by the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA), which stipulates that culling the animals can be a \"legitimate last resort to preserve the population.\"Seven protesters arrested after scaling fences to enter zooThe plan sparked regular protests with activists chaining and gluing themselves to the zoo entrance and baboon enclosures, and others scaling fences to gain entry on Tuesday.Authorities say seven people who broke into the zoo on Tuesday were arrested. One of those was a woman who had glued herself to the ground inside the entrance.Zoo management addressed the protests in a statement, saying, \"We know that many will find this decision hard to understand, that it has annoyed, upset or infuriated them.\"Nuremberg Zoo was closed for 'operational reasons' on TuesdayImage: Irena Güttel/dpa/picture allianceCulled animals regularly fed to lions, tigersThe German Animal Protection Association (Deutsche Tierschutzbund) released a statement claiming the zoo had broken a taboo, warning that other animals could follow.\"Responsibility for the well-being of animals that the zoo houses and breeds does not end when space gets tight or financing and organization become difficult,\" said the group in a statement.Rights groups are now calling for politicians to more closely regulate zoos and their breeding policies.The zoo's chief biologist, Jörg Beckmann, said neither pregnant females nor animals under scientific observation had been killed and added that the animals had been fed to predators after being shot.Zoo Director Encke acknowledged that animals are regularly put down and fed to lions and tigers, with others bred expressly for that purpose.He said the practice is not usually met with wide protest but suggested the situation with the baboons was perhaps different due to their being closely related to humans.Edited by: Sean SinicoJon SheltonWriter, translator and editor with DW's online news team.Send us your feedbackYour feedbackAdvertisement"

What lessons can be learned from the recent train derailment in southern Germany?https://p.dw.com/p/4yBR8After the deadly train accident in southwestern Germany, how can railway travel be made more climate-resilient — and safe?Image: dpa/picture allianceAdvertisementEmergency services were met with a scene of destruction. On Sunday evening, the grey-yellow cars of a regionaltrain had derailedand crashed into each other near Riedlingen in southwesternGermany.It soon became clear that the train driver, a trainee, and one passenger were killed in the accident. More than 40 out of around 100 passengers were injured, some of them seriously.Heavy rain in the area had apparently caused a sewer shaft to overflow, triggering a landslide directly onto the railway line and derailing the train.As man-madeclimate changeincreases the frequency of heavy rain, storms and otherextreme weather events,railways are increasingly affected.Heavy rain has caused the train to derail on Sunday, July 27Image: Thomas Warnack/dpa/picture allianceTrains still cleaner and safer than carsOverall, however, traveling by train is not only more sustainable than flying, it is also far safer than driving cars. Moreover, in recent years, the EU region has seen a decline in fatalities from train accidents.To prevent landslides and flooding of road underpasses during heavy rainfall, the German railway companyDeutsche Bahnhas been working on a heavy rainfall plan: When water damages a section of railway, it is usually detected before the next train approaches.Flooding has been a serious problem in the past, for example, with the 2021flood disaster in the Ahr Valleyin western Germany and neighboring regions, which killed 185 people.The railway lines through the Ahr Valley and the neighboring Eifel mountain rangestill remain partially closedto traffic. On the Ahr river, the floods destroyed a total of 15 railway bridges. Several bridges in the Eifel region need to be rebuilt.New bridges are being designed to better withstand extreme weather. The new structures will largely do without central pillars, to reduce exposure to water pressure and debris during floods.A large part of the investment of around €500 million ($578m) is being spent on the electrification of two lines, which were previously served by diesel engines.Once the electricity for the electric trains comes from renewable energy sources, they will emit significantly less greenhouse gases than diesel locomotives.New bridges in the Ahr valley are being designed to be more resilient to climate changeImage: Marc John/Bonn.digital/picture allianceHow to safeguard trains from fire and strong wind?However, this year's early summer was marked less by rain than by periods ofheat and droughtin large parts of Germany. The resultingforest fires and firesalong the railroad infrastructure forced connections to be cancelled or rerouted.To mitigate this, railway teams regularly trim vegetation in a six-meter-wide corridor along the tracks.Until 2023, Deutsche Bahn used the controversial herbicideglyphosate, whereas now it uses the lessenvironmentally harmfulpelargonic acid.Since 2024, Deutsche Bahn has been testing whether fire risk can be minimized by watering embankments with specially equipped trains. This technique is primarily intended for use during hazardous tasks, such as welding work on rails during drought periods.Train traffic is also at risk from strong winds that can bring down trees from outside the six-meter safety zone. These trees are monitored by Digital Vegetation Management, the railway's AI system. Fed with satellite images and video recordings of specific routes, it is designed to issue warnings of potentially dangerous trees.A hotter climate triggers more faults on the lineIn order to adapt its infrastructure toclimate change, the German railway company also sought advice from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.According to a study published shortly before the 2021 Ahr Valley floods, on days with temperatures above 30 degrees Celsius (86 Fahrenheit), there are on average 4.1 more fault reports in each of Germany's 34 regional railway districts than on days below 30 degrees. At temperatures above 32 degrees, this figure rises to 5.1 more fault reports.In the past, extreme heat even caused rails to bend. On July 28, 1969, a connection running between West Germany's Düsseldorf and Leipzig in the former East Germany derailed about 40 kilometers from the inner-German border, killing four people.At the time, rails were built and fastened in a way that allowed the steel to expand in all directions at high temperatures.The tracks between West Germany's Düsseldorf and Leipzig in the former East Germany bent in July 1967 and the resulting accident killed four"

And not just because theNeolithicsettlement was one of the oldest continually inhabited places in the world.Researchers believed that women had an elevated societal position in Catalhoyuk, now a UNESCO World Heritage Site in contemporaryTurkey.But that hunch was only based on figurines they had found and believed to represent Anatolian mother goddesses.Only with the methods of modernarchaeologywere researchers able to turn their feelings into fact: Society in the Catalhoyuk of 9,000 years ago wascentered around women. An international research team led bygeneticistsfrom the Middle East Technical University inAnkarapublished theirfindings in the journalScience.The researchers came to their conclusion after examining 131 skeletons they had discovered buried right under houses the people of Catalhoyuk had inhabited.DNAanalysis showed that people buried under the same house were often related — on their mother's side. In other words, when a man and a woman entered a partnership in the Neolithic settlement, they moved in with the family of the woman, not that of the man. Households were formed on a matrilineal basis.And there was another indication that women had a higher status than men: Archaeologists found as many as five times the grave goods buried with female bodies than with male ones.Gene therapy helps doctors treat genetic disordersTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 videoWas Catalhoyuk a matriarchy?In the more recent past, patrilineal households, where women move in with their male partner's family after marriage, were more common — and formed a patriarchy. So, does the reverse mean that the residents of Catalhoyuk, who lived from about 7100 to 6000 B.C.E., lived in a matriarchy?Not necessarily, saidprehistoric archaeologist Eva Rosenstock, who took part in the excavation in Catalhoyuk and researches scientific and cultural archaeology.\"Whether a society is matrilocal or patrilocal generally doesn't tell you anything about who has the power,\" Rosenstock told DW. \"But those things often go hand in hand.\"Switching children with neighborsDigging up, if you will, usableDNA for genetic analysiswas not an easy feat for the researchers.Catalhoyuk was located in a region with a continental climate, with strong fluctuations between winter and summer. Under these conditions, even teeth, which were known until recently as one of the best source ofDNA, do not keep forever.But there is a tiny part of the human body that has turned out to be the perfect source of DNA in adverse conditions such as those in the Catalhoyuk region: the petrous part of the temporal bone, located in the inner ear.\"It's like a DNA safe!\" said Rosenstock.It was through analyzing the material in this \"DNA safe\" that researchers discovered the matrilineal relationship between people buried under the same house.But not all people buried under the same house were related. The archaeologists assume that it wasn't out of the ordinary in Catalhoyuk society to switch children, so that your child would grow up in a different family close by. This was probably done in an effort to guarantee equal distribution of resources and, according to experts, points to society valuing the idea of equal rights for all.One of the discoveries made in Catalhoyuk was the skeleton of a newbornImage: Çatalhöyük Research Project/Peter F. Biehl\"If your own child grows up three doors down, you're probably not going to advocate for just your household to get the best of everything,\" said Rosenstock.But how did a society valuing equality and centered on women turn into the patriarchy that has dominated Central Europe in the more recent past? Rosenstock doesn't have an answer — at least not yet: \"That's the next exciting question.\"This article was originally written in German.Carla BleikerEditor, channel manager and reporter focusing on US politics and science@cbleikerSend us your feedbackYour feedbackAdvertisement"

India has made progress in growing and stabilizing its tiger population, but the big cats still face serious threats that jeopardize their future.https://p.dw.com/p/4yCV3Around three-quarters of the world's wild tigers live in India, despite rapidly growing urbanization and human population.Image: RealityImages/Zoonar/picture allianceAdvertisementIndia has theworld's largest tiger population, home to more than 3,600 wild tigers, which represent about 75% of the global wild tiger population, inhabiting an area of 138,200 square kilometers (53,360 square miles), according to the 2023 All-India Tiger Estimation Report, which containsfiguresfrom the country's most recent tiger census.Indian Prime MinisterNarandra Modiat the time emphasized the \"responsibility of doing even more to protect the tiger as well as other animals.\"But despite the healthy numbers, stabilizing and securing the future of tigers requirescontinued and complex efforts.Why are tigers still at risk?Deforestation, expansion of agriculture, urbanization and infrastructure projects have increasingly fragmented tiger habitats. As a result, continuous tiger habitats have been divided into smaller patches — affecting their movement, breeding and the availability of prey.\"Charismatic mammals are part of varied natural ecosystems and this unhealthy focus on the population size of large mammals has blinded us from the overall deterioration of functional natural ecosystems,\" wildlife conservationist Ravi Chellam told DW.Chellam pointed out that it is not merely the size of habitats, but their quality that constrains tiger survival and recovery. Therefore, ensuring prey-rich, well-managed and protected habitats is key.\"Most ecosystems have been degraded by the phenomenal increase in the presence of invasive species, fragmented and even destroyed by numerous 'development' projects and with impacts of climate change being felt across the country,\" said Chellam.India has 58 tiger reserves spread across 18 states. Of late, the fragmentation of tiger habitats has become severe in areas where forests overlap with expanding human settlements, agriculture and infrastructure corridors.For instance, the central Indian region is home to several major tiger reserves — including Kanha, Pench, Tadoba, Satpura and Bandhavgarh. However, roads, railways, mines, and agricultural expansion have fragmented the forests and isolated tiger populations.Fragmentation dents years of tiger recoveryProminent corridors — such as those connecting the tiger reserves in Kanha and Pench, as well as Tadoba and Indravati — are under significant pressure. Sariska Tiger Reserve in the western Rajasthan corridor faces grave ecological risks from the government's move to address concerns about mining operations near Sariska.India's tiger population bounces backTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 videoThis change is intended to facilitate the reopening of more than 50 marble, dolomite, limestone, and masonry stone mines that were previously shut down by a Supreme Court order due to their proximity to core tiger habitats.The proposed plan to redraw the boundaries of the Sariska Tiger Reserve would remove more than 4,800 hectares from the critical tiger habitat, according to Jhatkaa.org, a digital campaigning organization.\"This reduction threatens vital wildlife corridors that are crucial for tiger movement, seasonal refuge, and territorial establishment,\" said the group.Threats loom for Bengal tigersSimilarly, the Sundarbans mangrove forest spreading across parts of Bangladesh and the eastern state of West Bengal is one of the largest reserves for the Bengal tiger. But rising sea levels and coastal erosion are destroying the tigers' natural habitat.Yadvendradev Jhala, a prominent wildlife scientist and former dean at the Wildlife Institute of India, said that India has monitored the distribution and profusion of tigers every four years since 2006.India has now adopted modern techniques such as camera trapping, genetic analysis, and the Monitoring System for Tigers: Intensive Protection and Ecological Status (M-STrIPES) to assist effective patrolling, assess ecological status and mitigate human-wildlife conflict in and around tiger reserves.Rising human-wildlife conflict\"We found that tigers would persist in protected habitats with ample prey, while becoming extinct in areas of increased human and social disturbances,\" Jhala told DW.Tiger habitats in the states of Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and eastern Maharashtra have been affected by ongoing armed insurgencies. These conflict zones coincide with areas where tiger occupancy is low and the probability of local extinction is high, according to astudypublished inScience.\"These are areas where wi"

As part of that deal, 28-year-old Wang will run the new Meta superintelligence division as chief AI officer.A Silicon Valley cultural shift?Among Big Tech, Meta is not alone in its AI buildup.

The mania was fueled by celebrity Labubu collectors such asBlackpink's Lisa,Rihanna, Dua Lipa and David Beckham.Hot on the heels of the viral Labubu craze, influencers have also been hyping another collectible furry toy that could be seen as the \"ancestor\" of the plush creepy-cute monster: The Monchhichi.Popular worldwide in the 1980s, the plastic-faced monkey doll was created by Japanese designer Yoshiharu Washino for the Sekiguchi Corporation.Labubu toys set out to take Germany by stormTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 videoReleased in 1974, the doll's first exposure to the international market came a year later at the Nuremberg Toy Fair, allowing the Japanese company to launch the toys in German-speaking countries.They were a huge success in Europe. By the late 1970s, more Monchhichi dolls were sold in Germany than in Japan.Global fame followed when US toy company Mattel started marketing the fluffy dolls in 1980. A cartoon series called \"Monchhichis,\" produced by Hanna-Barbera, was released worldwide to promote them. But five years later, Mattel felt the sales weren't strong enough, and dropped the line.Still, the Monchhichis were relaunched in the United States in 2004 to mark the 30th anniversary of the toy.With the dolls now sold in stores like Urban Outfitters, Monchhichi marketers are no longer targeting children but rather young adults drawn to quirky-nostalgic trends.Monchhichi dolls are still popular todayImage: Revierfoto/dpa/picture allianceSpot the fakeLabubu collectors who search for rare models online need to figure out if they are about to buy an authentic toy monster elf, created by Hong Kong-Dutch designer Kasing Lung, or rather a fake \"Lafufu\" — as the counterfeit dolls are colloquially referred to.The internet is filled with tips allowing fans to spot the differences between the two. The copycats are obviously less refined than the designer models. Kids are being teased by their friends if they show up with a figure that has 10 or eight teeth instead of nine — the ultimate sign that it's not the real thing.Similarly, copies of the Monchhichi can be found all over the world.But the version of the doll sold in formerEast Germany,or the German Democratic Republic (GDR), bypassed the authenticity issue by taking on a different name: the Tiemi.The Tiemi was the East German version of the MonchhichiImage: PrivatMonchhichi behind the Iron CurtainWhile the Monchhichi's popularity boomed in West Germany, it wasn't available in the communist East, which banned the import and the sale of capitalist consumer items.The Tiemi, whose namesake was toy designer Susanne Tieme, was produced in the small town of Sonneberg that was already a toy-producing hub at the beginning of 20th century.When Sonneberg landed in the Soviet-controlled eastern part of Germany after World War II, the region's numerous family businesses were nationalized into so-called people-owned enterprises.One such state business in Sonnerberg manufactured the Tiemi, which became very popular and was exported throughout Eastern Bloc countries.But following German reunifcation in 1990, the plant was sold and privatized and production ceasedToday, plush figures made in Sonneberg have become collectors' items. An internet search for \"Sonni DDR\" toys leads to a wide variety of dolls that some might find even creepier than Labubus.Edited by: Stuart BraunElizabeth GrenierEditor and reporter for DW CultureSend us your feedbackYour feedbackAdvertisement"

What challenges could it face and what could it mean for other bids?https://p.dw.com/p/4y7neThe 2025 Diamond League went to in Qatar, a country that has a long history of hosting world championshipsImage: Noushad/IMAGOAdvertisementGiven the football World Cup was in the country just three years ago, the eight major global championships the country has hosted this year alone, and the Asian Games scheduled to take place in there in 2030,Qatarbidding for the 2036Olympicsfeels like the next logical step for the Gulf country.The difference this time around is all about scale. There will be 36 sports on show in Los Angeles in 2028, with a variety of disciplines inside each sport. Then there is the political aspect of an Olympic Games, which is different to that of a footballWorld Cup.Still, Jean-Loup Chappelet, professor of public management at the University of Lausanne and Olympic scholar, believes Qatar's history of hosting means they are very capable of hosting a Summer Olympics.\"Having the facilities is not the most important for the Olympics nowadays,\" Chappelet told DW.Instead, he said, there are two key criteria that the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has been looking for in a host country in recent years.\"One is political support and the other is popular support. It's more important than the venues. In fact, the venues can be changed, like we have seen a lot in LA (Los Angeles) recently and also inBrisbane. So nobody doubts that the venues are available. What is important is political support from the public authorities.\"Weather and image problematicGiven the average high temperature in Qatar in July is 44 degrees Celciuis (111 Fahrenheit), hosting an Olympic Games at that time of the year is out of the question.\"It would have to be in November, like the World Cup 2022,\" said the Frenchman, who worked on the bid for the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville.\"Can we do (that)? It could probably happen, but it's a big problem because the whole sports calendar is organized around the Olympics.\"At the 2019 Worlds in Doha, many athletes suffered from the hot conditions despite races starting at nightImage: Anke Waelischmiller/Sven Simon/IMAGOAssuming that were possible, then there's also the question of the two aforementioned criteria. Given that national political support isn't likely to be a problem, attention will turn to popular support.An easy way to gauge this is through a referendum, as was held inGermany regarding the mere idea of bidding for the 2036 Games.However, Chappelet isn't so sure he can see Qatar conducting something similar.\"In general, the IOC is satisfied with polls,\" he explained.\"The polls are conducted by an independent company. So they see what is the (level of) popular support. The problem in Qatar is that the local population is rather small and there's a large migrant population. So the validity of this popular support is to be discussed, for sure.\"If that support is also secured, there's also the issue of dealing with neighboringSaudi Arabia. If Qatar won the bid, this would likely prevent Saudi Arabia from hosting the Olympics for many years. But with the 2034 World Cup already confirmed to be in Saudi Arabia, it would seem likely that the kingdom would want to host an Olympics soon after that.Assuming none of that is a problem though, the final hurdle is the broader impact of the IOC choosing Qatar.\"Human rights are quite important\" Chappelet said. \"Especially for theconstruction of the facilities, the state and the workers. And so there were big problems there. Qatar made some efforts but the the image-perception of Qatar is not as good as it can be for other countries.\"Despite the years of criticism though, the World Cup did take place in Qatar.\"It's not insurmountable,\" Chappelet said. \"It can be done. Of course they [IOC] will have a lot of criticism, but the question is whether the IOC wants to bear all this criticism or whether they will take another less risky path?\"FIFA took a lot of criticism after selecting Qatar for the 2022 World Cup due to human rights issues, but the tournament still took placeImage: Chandan Khanna/AFP/Getty ImagesDo India, Korea and Indonesia have a chance?Chappelet believes the confirmation of Qatar's bid will force the others into action.\"It means they have to rehab a little bit,\" Chappelet said. Given the heat, the current doping issues and the poor results on the field of competition, Chappelet believes that India is already out of the running.South Koreais also in the mix but the strength of its bid depends on the outcome of next year's mayoral election in Seoul, whileChileis likely one for the more distant future given it will be Asia's turn. The Games are supposed to rotate every season, and with the 2028 edition to be in North America "

European bond yields fell, signaling investor optimism that transatlantic trade tensions may be easing.Under the agreement, a15% US tariffwill be levied on most exports from theEuropean Union, and the bloc will commit €514 billion ($600 billion) in investment to the US — its largest trading partner. Tariffs on some sectors have yet to be finalized.While the new 15% rate is less severe than the 25% tariff imposed on European automakers in April and the 30% levy previously scheduled for August 1, it still represents a sharp increase from the 2.5% duty in place before US PresidentDonald Trump'ssecond term began.European CommissionPresidentUrsula von der Leyentold reporters that the new tariff rate was \"a good deal,\" adding it would return \"stability\" and \"predictability\" to transatlantic trade. She cautioned that \"15% is not to be underestimated, but it is the best we could get.\"German ChancellorFriedrich Merzechoed that sentiment, calling the agreement a means to \"preserve our core interests\" and avert \"an unnecessary escalation in transatlantic trade relations.\" Yet he admitted disappointment over the outcome, stating, \"I would have very much wished for further relief.\"Who won, who lost in the US-EU trade deal?To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 videoEU criticized over 'scandalous' dealWhile EU policymakers maintain they succeeded in negotiating Trump down from harsher tariffs, many European political and business leaders have condemned the new deal as damaging to the 27-member bloc. The EU had originally sought a 10% tariff.Hungarian Prime MinisterViktor Orbanoffered a biting critique during a Facebook livestream, saying: \"Trump ate Ursula von der Leyen for breakfast,\" adding that the deal is \"worse\" than the one theUnited Kingdomclinched in May.Under that deal, most British exports still face a blanket 10% US tariff, while economists have warned the US-UK agreement lacks depth and leaves key sectors — like pharmaceuticals and agriculture — exposed.French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou called the deal a \"dark day,\" lamenting how the EU, \"an alliance of free peoples, brought together to affirm their common values and to defend their common interests, resigns itself to submission.\"Former high-profile European lawmaker Guy Verhofstadt, meanwhile, labeled the deal \"scandalous\" and a \"disaster.\" In comments on X, he decried the lack of \"a single concession from the American side\" and criticized the EU’s \"poorly negotiated\" approach.Former European Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom told DW it was \"not a good deal, but maybe the only possible one.\"\"They [EU negotiators] should have been tougher from the beginning ... a small retaliation [measure] was only kept for 24 hours and then withdrawn. Not doing anything else didn't show strength.\"German MEP Bernd Lange, who chairs theEuropean Parliament'strade committee, wrote on X that the deal was \"lopsided\" and that Brussels had made concessions that were \"difficult to accept.\"French entrepreneur Arnaud Bertrand went further, calling the deal \"a one-way transfer of wealth,\" adding that \"it rather looks like the type of unequal treaties that colonial powers used to impose in the 19th century — except this time, Europe is on the receiving end.\"Ruben Staffa, foreign trade expert at the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW Berlin), said the deal marks \"almost a tenfold increase in the average tariffs that applied before Trump's second term.\"What are the positives for the EU?The deal helps the EU sidestep a full-scale trade war that could have severely disrupted business confidence and consumer spending on both sides of the Atlantic.In anticipation of steeper US tariffs, Brussels had prepared €72 billion in retaliatory measures on American imports, including levies targeting aircraft and automobiles.Additional options reportedly included export restrictions on certain steel and chemical products, as well as possible moves against US services — particularly inBig Techand finance — where the US holds a €109 billion trade surplus with the EU.While far from ideal, the agreement’s economic impact is expected to be relatively "

Some looked healthy.Bear in mind, the participants were not presented withrealsick people (a person in the same room as them), or even images of sick people butunrealimages.And their immune systems still reacted.\"We can conclude that the brain has the capacity to distinguish virtual infectious patterns, become activated, and link this activation to a downstream response, resulting in systemic immunity,\" wrote Camilla Jandus, co-author of the study paper and head of the Jandus Lab, University of Geneva, in an email to DW.Jandus and colleague Andrea Serino published their paper today in the journalNature Neuroscience.When an avatar makes you feel sickThe researchers monitored participants'brain activitywhile they looked at the avatars. This allowed them to track reactions to the visuals.For example, they noticed that participants reacted stronger when a sick-looking avatar moved closer to them in the virtual reality. Jandus and Serino took this to mean the brain was sounding an alarm.The researchers checked these reactions with a \"control group\" of avatars that either stood farther or looked healthy when they appeared to approach a participant.

And all that before a pathogen had entered the body in reality.How the VR findings could be used in realityThe team are considering various applications for their research including using VR stimuli to boost standard vaccination, to modulate immunity in people withautoimmune or inflammatory diseases, or as a non-pharmacological approach to treat people with allergies.\"This represents a therapeutic opportunity,\" said Jandus. \"We are testing this idea in allergies, such as bee and wasp allergies, whereby repetitive exposures to virtual bee or wasp stings might lead to desensitization inallergic patients.\"While there is no experimental evidence to yet confirm whether there was a risk of VR stimuli leading to an overreactive immune system, Jandus said \"repetitive exposure to the stimuli, would rather result in a kind of 'tolerance.'\"Edited by: Matthew Ward AgiusZulfikar AbbanySenior editor fascinated by space, AI and the mind, and how science touches peopleSend us your feedbackYour feedbackAdvertisement"

Here are five things you need to know about W:O:A.https://p.dw.com/p/4y9NmMetalheads unite at Wacken every AugustImage: Christian Ender/PIC ONE/picture allianceAdvertisement1. From provincial festival to international metal meccaTheWacken Open Air festival, also known as W:O:A, began in 1990 as a small festival with just 800 rock fans and a few local metal bands. The initial venue was a former gravel pit on the outskirts of the village of Wacken northwest of the Germany city of Hamburg. Today, the four-day event is one of the biggest and best-known metal festivals in the world, attended by around 185,000 fans from over 80 countries.The festival usually sells out within hours, although tickets are getting more expensive — €333 ($386) this year — and the event is becoming increasingly commercialized. Nevertheless, Wacken has become a meeting place for the metal community. When in Wacken, be prepared to encounter the familiar \"devils horn\" metalhead salute — a raised fist with outstretched index and pinky fingers — as well as the familiar battle cry: \"Wackeeeeeen!\"How Wacken became a metal meccaTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 video2. A temporary metropolisDuring the festival week, the village of Wacken transforms into a metropolis of around 95,000 people. This includes fans, tens of thousands of crew members and helpers as well as hundreds of musicians and media from all over the world. The 240-hectare site has a completely independent infrastructure with over 1,300 toilets, hundreds of showers, its own electricity and water supply, waste collection and even a small police station. There are also mobile medical stations, field kitchens, shuttle buses and a sophisticated traffic management system.Even in heavy rain and mud — a Wacken classic — the show goes on. Tons of wood chips as a base, a drainage system and local farmers, who pull stuck vehicles out of the mud with their tractors, make the festival possible even under difficult weather conditions. But back in 2023, the mud gained the upper hand: the festival site was largely impassable, forcing around 235,000 fans to turn back. The festival was almost canceled altogether.Metal and mud often combine at WackenImage: AP3. A beer pipelineWhether day or night, many metalheads traditionally maintain a steady flow ofbeer. To prevent the taps from running dry, an underground beer pipeline was built in 2017. It connects central tanks with several taps on the site and can transport up to 10,000 liters (2,642 gallons) ofbeerper hour. This saves on transportation, protects the roads and ensures supplies are uninterrupted.Culinary offerings at the festival range from currywurst fries to vegan falafel pockets, and the food trucks can be found throughout the festival grounds. A new payment system has been in place since 2022. The festival wristband also contains a chip that can be topped up with a debit or credit card at numerous stations. This can be used to pay throughout the festival site. Cash or card payments aren't possible.The beer flows freely at Germany's metal meccaImage: Daniel Reinhardt/dpapicture alliance4. More than metalOf course, metal takes center stage atWacken— in all its forms. The big acts play on three main stages named \"Faster,\" \"Harder\" and \"Louder.\" Major acts performing this year include Guns N' Roses, Papa Roach, Machine Head and Gojira, among others. Fans gather in front of the stages on what's known as the Infield, also referred to as the \"Holy Ground\" or \"Holy Field.\"But the festival also offers a variety of areas with different events and activities. In the Wackinger Village, for example, fans will find jugglers, knights, fire shows and medieval bands. The food is also a bit different here and includes hearty dishes such as suckling pig, oxen on a spit, stews and soups, as well as medieval-style desserts anddrinkslike mead or fruit wines.Fans pay tribute to late heavy metal legend Ozzy OsbourneTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 videoAnother area known as Wasteland has a post-apocalyptic design, with flame throwers and scrap metal buildings reminiscent of \"Mad Max.” A group of artists known as the \"Wasteland Warriors\" provides the apocalyptic flair with fire and smoke. The area also features a stage with performers playing mainly industrialmusic.The Beergarden is a popular meeting place for metalheads who want to take it a little easier. Playing here is the fire department band \"Wacken Firefighters,\" who deliver a feel-good atmosphere with brass band versions of well-known rock classics.Other stages also feature comedy, spoken word, metal yoga, wrestling and readings.Fantasy and creativity are "

DW spoke to Niinisto about the diplomatic efforts to end Russia's war in Ukraine, NATO, and the Helsinki Accords.https://p.dw.com/p/4y8MYFormer Finnish President Sauli Niinisto shared his knowledge about Putin and Russia with Donald TrumpImage: Petras Malukas/AFP/Getty ImagesAdvertisementDW:President Niinisto,we are speaking after a third meeting betweenRussiaandUkrainein Istanbul, Turkey this year that again failed to produce results toend the war. Do you see any chances for diplomacy to broker at least a ceasefire in the near future?Sauli Niinisto: What we've seen for more than three years is the continuation of the war. It seems that neither Russia nor Ukraine is going to achieve a complete victory. So if nothing else, we must try to reach an agreement through diplomacy.It looks like the European leaders do not know whether they should callVladimir Putinor not. Germany's then-ChancellorOlaf Scholz called Putinin 2024. President Emmanuel Macron of France called him a few weeks ago. US President Donald Trump called him many times. Do you see any reason to continue phone conversations with Putin?Chancellor Scholz was heavily criticized after he called. But when Trump started doing it regularly, and then Macron took the same step, he was not criticized. So, in a way, European opinion followedPresident Trumphere. I guess Trump will continue his kind of diplomacy, and in my opinion, if he does, Europe has to be involved somehow.Russia's war in Ukraine: A timeline of diplomatic effortsTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 videoIn 2018 in Helsinki, when you met both Putin and Trump, Fiona Hill,who was an advisor to Trump at the time,said that you briefed Trump about Putin and Russia. What did you tell him, and what did he say to you?I told him that Putin is a fighter. You have to oppose him. That's very necessary. It doesn't break the discussion. I had the feeling that Putin likes a fight ― that we've seen that in other areas too. That's one element. Another is that whatever new ideas or views Putin supports, be careful if you're not completely aware of everything it might involve.One thing I learned is that he often opens an idea very modestly, even though he's been developing it in his mind for a long time. If you touch it, you're easily drawn into it. So I told Trump, if you don't fully understand what he means, or if it's a completely unknown idea, don't get involved. I also said that Putin likes to be respected ― not accepted, but respected. He considers it respectful when he's opposed, when you fight back.It seems like Donald Trump changed his attitude towards Russia recently. He now uses strong language to criticize Putin and he agreed to let Europeans buyAmerican weapons for Ukraine. Is this a turning point or do you think he can still change his mind and stop support for Ukraine?That's a difficult question. I still believe Trump wants to be a peacemaker. I think his position regarding Putin is still the same. But yes, in a way, it is a turning point. We've seen some of those already. Becoming stronger in that discussion, that's already a turning point in itself.What do you think of Trump's 50-day ultimatum to Russia to end the war or face tougher sanctions? Could that bring a ceasefire closer?There have been time limits before. I think Trump's concrete actions and statements are more meaningful than just the \"50 days\" limit.Do you think Vladimir Putin could agree to Ukraine's EU membership?I think he has said publicly ― at least a few years ago ― that it's OK.Yes, but now we hear from Moscow that they may not be so happy about this, because they see Europe as a warlike organization. They say the EU is militarizing. What do you think?First of all, I hope that Europe becomes a lot stronger militarily. But it's not up to Russia to decide about EU enlargement. That's not their business.When I said I'd like to see a stronger Europe, I was thinking of a speech Putin gave in 2013 or 2014, where he said the West is weak because people are too idealistic and not ready to face real-world challenges. That's something we have to take seriously. Are we prepared to protect Europe and our countries?If you have an aggressive neighbor like Russia who thinks you're weak, that's a dangerous combination. So Europe must show strength and be seen as strong from the outside.Has the relationship between Trump and Putin gone sour?To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 videoYoucomposed a report for the European Unionin which you said that Europe was not strong enough.

That crowbar, labeled \"Bau-Turbo\" (construction turbo), is a new paragraph (§ 246e) to be inserted into the German Building Code.If the legislation is passed in the fall, municipalities will be able to approve construction, change-of-use and renovation projects that deviate from the provisions of the Building Code if those projects are for the construction of new residential buildings.Planning applications will also be automatically approved after two months unless vetoed by the municipality.Germany: Augsburg's practically rent-free housingTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 videoBuilding regulations vary between each of Germany's 16 states and among municipalities, resulting in an ever-growing patchwork of rules governing everything from the number of electric sockets per room to the shape and color of roofs.The Construction Ministry estimates its legislative amendment, to be passed by the Bundestag in the fall, will save companies, citizens and local authorities around €2.5 billion ($2.9 billion) annually.An 'opportunity,' not an overnight fixTim-Oliver Müller, the managing director of the Federal Association of the German Construction Industry (HDB), said he welcomed the government's plans but warned that housing construction \"would not pick up again overnight.\"\"The law alone will not result in a single new apartment, but it will make it easier for local authorities to approve them,\" Müller told DW.He said a \"melange of crises\" has hit Germany's construction industry, largely as a result of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, rising energy prices, the increased cost of materials such as concrete and steel, inflation and a jump in interest rates from below 1% to between 3% and 4%.Müller is convinced that the new changes to the law would not reduce quality standards — for example, those regarding fire safety and structural integrity, which remain in place.The new legislation is \"purely a creation of possibilities, for example, with regard to building extensions or changing the designation of land from commercial to residential, something that was not previously possible,\" Müller explained.#DailyDrone: Berlin Modernist housing estatesTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 videoA lot of hot air?Environmentalists have expressed concern about easing planning regulations because they fear green spaces will be built on as new development projects are waved through with less time for local residents to object.\"Only with green spaces can we buffer [heatwaves]. Because these green spaces provide active cooling,\" Stefan Petzold from the nature conservation association NABU told ARD.Another person concerned about hot air is Matthias Günther, the head of the Pestel Institute, which researches areas like the economy and housing for the public and private sectors. He described the new legislation as \"a lot of hot air\" that will \"not achieve anything in the short term.\"\"Additional paragraphs and sections will be added to the Building Code, creating more bureaucracy. Some things will require the municipality's consent, and, especially when it comes to building, they often have problems getting a majority because there's always someone who doesn't want it,\" Günther told DW.He says that Germany really needs an economic stimulus package for housing construction starting in the fall, accompanied by a loan program with interest rates fixed at 2% for the next 20 years.\"The city would essentially pass on its more favorable credit conditions. It wouldn't cost that much.

Just as it had been for the country’smen at Euro 2024and women in the World Cup the year before that. But it turned out it was another old tale that was to be repeated,Chloe Kellycoming off the bench to win the Euros for England.Just as she had in Euro 2022, when she broke German hearts byscoring in extra time at Wembley, so it was in Switzerland, as Kelly hammered home the penalty that retained the trophy for her country. Earlier the two sides had traded headed goals either side of halftime, Mariona Caldentey for Spain, Alessia Russo for England.Even before her penalty, Kelly had changed the game, providing the cross from Russo and once again England’s strength in depth was decisive. It is the first time England has won a major tournament outside of their own country. It has been far from smooth sailing though, ascoach Sarina Wiegmanalluded to post-match.Chloe Kelly scored the winner at Euro 2022 and the decisive penalty at Euro 2025 on SundayImage: Stefan Wermuth/REUTERS\"I cannot believe it. The word team describes who we are. I am so proud of them and the staff,\" the coach, who also won the 2017 tournament with her native Netherlands told the BBC. \"I have a medal around my neck and we have the trophy. It has been the most chaotic tournament, from the first day it’s been chaos. From losing your opening game and winning the trophy, incredible.\"Never beatenAs well as that opening loss to France, England had to muster late comebacks against Sweden and Italy in the quarter and semifinals. In fact, they were only ahead for four minutes and 52 seconds in their three knockout matches.\"Playing for this England team is unbelievable. You cannot put us down,\" concluded captain Leah Williamson. \"To do this again, this is the toughest. How women’s football has changed and for us to do it again. The stakes, everything was high. We have ridden our luck [but] we aren’t lucky.\"England has also had to deal with the racist abuse of defender Jess Carter on social media after the Sweden game. The squad responded by stopping taking the knee, an anti-racism gesture first used by American Football quarterback Colin Kapernick that spread across the globe.\"Taking the knee, that's not enough. We have done that for a while. The impact is not good enough, it's not as big as we think,\" Wiegman said.Carter's comebackAfter being dropped for the dramatic semifinal win over Italy, sealed by a 119th minute Kelly goal, Carter returned for the final and excelled as England dealt with waves of Spanish attacks.\"I just couldn’t be prouder. I feel speechless,\" said the Chelsea player post-match. \"I feel relief, excitement. I want to say a massive thank you to our fans, my friends and family. For anyone who doubted us, doubted me, this [is what we do].\"The Lionesses, as England’s women’s team is known, have been consistent advocates for equality and have enjoyed a high profile since the home tournament three years ago. That win spurredmassive increases in attendances in the domestic league (WSL)and in participation among women and girls in the sport. That, and investment by the English Football Association over the last decade or so, has taken England from the middle of the pack to the only team that can compete with Spain.World Cup win marred by Rubiales' kissThe two countries have now won the last three major international trophies and the last three Champions League titles (the highest honor at club level in Europe), after Arsenal beat Barcelona in this year’s final.But for Spain, it has been the technical brilliance of a generation of mostly Barcelona players, led by Aitana Bonmati, who missed a penalty in the shootout but won player of the tournament, and Alexia Putellas, that has achieved so much.That's despite a federation led until recently by Luis Rubiales, whose unwanted kiss on player Jenni Hermoso became a global lightning rod for issues of sexual consent and ended with him beingfound guilty of sexual assaultearlier this year. The behavior of Rubiales andformer coach Jorge Vildahad already led several Spanish players to boycott the World Cup.Though they got there by different methods, the new era of dominance for England and Spain may prove problematic for the rest of women’s football, with more traditional European powerhouses like Germany and Norway not commercializing their domestic and international teams as rapidly. But few in England will care about that when the trophy is paraded in front of Buckingham Palace "

Some aboard reacted angrily to the portside protest, waving Israeli flags and even insulting the demonstrators, calling out \"may your village burn,\" a slogan popular with Israeli right-wing extremists.The cruise line ultimately decided the passengers shouldn't disembark at Syros and continued on its journey to Cyprus.It's not often this kind of thing happens inGreece, where there have been fewer pro-Palestinian demonstrations than in many other European countries.Dockworkers' unions speak out against military shipmentsBut every now and again, there has been some anti-Israel action in the seafaring EU nation.On July 16, dockworkers and activists tried to prevent the unloading of steel meant for military purposes in Israel. The activists said the cargo was transferred from one ship, the Ever Golden, to another, the Cosco Shipping Pisces, in an attempt to keep the cargo \"under the radar.\" The dockworkers' union said that they wouldn't allow the port to become a base for any military actions.There were similar protest actions in October 2024, and these are expected to continue.A pro-Palestinian demonstration was held in Athens' main harbor, Piraeus, earlier this monthImage: Stelios Misinas/REUTERSMeanwhile, the episode on Syros has led to heated debate in Greece. Many locals say the protest was racist and some called the demonstrators \"shameless fascists.\" Others supported the demonstrators, saying the Israeli tourists should be informed of what their government doing in Gaza.Those who are firmly on Israel's side have accused the others of antisemitism. This is despite the fact that among those Greeks are someright-wing extremistswho are actually traditionally antisemitic themselves. Now, however, they admire Israel's military strength and see Israel as an ally, mostly against Turkey, butalso against Muslims in general, whom they accuse of trying to change the European way of life.The pro-Palestinian group is mostly left wing, who insist their criticism has nothing to do with antisemitism. In fact, they say that antisemitism is being worsened by Israeli actions in Gaza.Political opinions flavor supportOpinion polls in Greece suggest that just under half of all locals are neutral about the conflict in Gaza. However, among the other half of the population, those who are not neutral, support for Israel has declined after almost two years of fighting in Gaza.In a survey by the Eteron Institute for Research and Social Change, conducted in late April, interviewees were asked who they most supported in the conflict. Just over 40% answered \"neither side.\" Of the rest, 30% favored the Palestinian side and 17.6% favored Israel. That's a significant change from November 2023 — immediately after the Hamas-led attacks on Israel on October 7 — when 34% supported Israel.Further detailed results show that almost 50% of those Greeks who support theconservative ruling party, New Democracy, also support Israel. Those who prefer the far-right party, Voice of Reason, also support Israel.In May 2021, long before the events of October 2023, these protesters in Athens spoke out about Israel's bombing of Gaza that yearImage: Angelos Tzortzinis/AFP/Getty ImagesAmong those who support PASOK, a social democratic party, only 12% like Israel while 34% are pro-Palestinian. The rest of the PASOK supporters are neutral.Further left though, of the Greeks who support the local Communist party and other left-wing parties, betwee"

Mining was launched by French nuclear group Areva, rebranded as Orano in 2018, which mothballed the mine in 2015 due to unfavorable market conditions.Since then, tensions have illustrated the fragility of a system in which military and diplomatic presence supported economic interests.Paris seeking new relationshipsBeyond the uranium sector, France's whole model of influence is being destabilized, affecting sectors like infrastructure, telecommunication, energy and public works — all symbols of France's presence that are now being regularly challenged.In July, the French military left its last base in Senegal and is now absent in west and central AfricaImage: Patrick Meinhardt/AFP/Getty ImagesIn February 2023, French PresidentEmmanuel Macronpresenteda new strategy, entitled \"Our Future The Africa-France Partnership,\" and offering new forms of partnerships.Unveiled by Macron ahead of his tour of Central Africa, the strategy advocates abandoning old paradigms and puts a new emphasis on economic and trade relations rather than focusing on security issues. The central idea of this new model is based on a transition from \"a logic of aid to a logic of solidarity investments and partnerships,\" and is meant to be a \"symbiotic relationship\" beneficial to all parties.What France used to consider as its \"backyard\" for a long time is disappearing amid wider change in the Sahel region.In addition, Africa as a whole is no longer France's exclusive business playground. Countries like Turkey, Russia, China and even Germany are advancing their positions, forcing French companies to readjust their business policy if they are to survive in an increasingly competitive environment.President Emmanuel Macron is trying to p"

Themassive sinkholesput over a thousand people at risk of losing their homes, prompting the state government to declare an emergency.Such sinkholes have appeared in cities in all around the world, including theUS,TurkeyandIran. They can appear suddenly, posing threats to lives and homes.What are sinkholes exactly?Sinkholes are depressions in the ground formed when water erodes soil. This can happen naturally when rainfall trickles through the soil, dissolving underlying bedrock. But it can also be the result of leaky underground water pipes, fracking for fossil fuels and mining activity.Sinkholes are more likely to occur in regions with \"karst terrain\" — areas made up of soluble bedrock such as limestone, salt beds, or gypsum — that can be dissolved by groundwater, said Hong Yang, environmental science professor with the UK's University of Reading. Yang has recently publishedresearch on mitigating sinkhole hazards intensified by climate change.\"In the United States, about 20% of the land is susceptible, with Florida, Texas, Alabama, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee and Pennsylvania experiencing the most significant damage,\" he told DW. Other hot spots include theUK, specifically areas like Ripon and the Yorkshire Dales in Northern England,Italy'sLazio region,Mexico'sYucatan Peninsula, parts ofChina, Iran and Turkey.What role does climate change play?Climate changeis increasing the frequency of sinkholes by intensifyingextreme weatherevents, according to research.\"Droughts lower the water table, removing subterranean support for the land above. When followed by intense storms or heavy rain — which are also becoming more common due to climate change — the sudden weight and saturation of water can cause the weakened ground to collapse,\" said Yang.He pointed to Turkey's breadbasket, the Konya Plain in central Anatolia. It's a karst terrain where increasing drought means more sinkholes are now opening up in populated regions.Before the 2000s, researchers in the area used to register one sinkhole every few years, said Fetullah Arik, a professor at Konya Technical University who heads the university's sinkhole research center. In 2024 alone, they documented 42.Sinkholes have been popping up much more frequently in Turkey's Konya Plain in recent yearsImage: Abdullah Coskun/Anadolu Agency/picture allianceGroundwater levels across the Konya Basin have dropped by at least 60 meters (197 feet) compared to 1970.\"In some areas close to the basin edges, groundwater cannot be found, although wells deeper than 300 meters are drilled,\" he added.Drought linked to climate change is lowering groundwater levels because rainfall is not replenishingwater sources. But because people still need access to water, they are pumping lots of it, which in turn, exacerbates the risk of sinkholes. In populated areas, that also means buildings are more vulnerable to collapse.\"If you pull water out of a juice box too fast, the sides cave in,\" said Antonios E. Marsellos, associate professor of geology, environment, and sustainability at Hofstra University in the state of New York.\"That's like pumping too much groundwater, so the support of the underground weakens and may collapse just like the juice box that bent.\"Marsellos, who publishedresearch on climate change effects on sinkhole formations,said it's made worse in big cities with air pollution where water gets more acidic and breaks down rock faster.Marsellos and his team looked at freeze-thaw cycles in Long Island, New York, over a period of close to 80 years and found that increased temperatures due to climate change has weakened the stability of the soil and has a direct impact on sinkhole formations.Can we prevent sinkholes?Experts rely on technologies such as satellite remote sensing and ground-penetrating radar to detect subtle ground subsidence and underground voids to spot sinkholes before they collapse, said Yang. Other detection methods include monitoring groundwater levels and conducting geotechnical surveys before building in the area.Sinkholes such as this one in Mexico's Puebla state can swallow large areas of landImage: José Castañares/AFPIf an empty void is found underground, experts then act like a dentist, said Marsellos.\"It's exactly the same thing that we do — we check if there is any cavity, basically any empty space under the ground that eventually will not be able to hold that empty space.\"Depending on local conditions such as the makeup of"

But how exactly do these products protect our skin?https://p.dw.com/p/4y112Sunscreens, when applied thoroughly and correctly, are an important protector against UV radiationImage: Dmitri Maruta/Zoonar/picture allianceAdvertisementSkin cancers, of which more than 300,000 new cases are diagnosed each year, are preventable. And yet cases continue to rise, particularly in regions of the world where numbers have previously been low.As well as avoiding direct sunlight and wearing protective clothing such as hats, long-sleeved shirts and pants, effective sunscreen products have been available for years. But as genuine concerns about product safetymix with mythsand falsehoods on social media and elsewhere online, some people may move away from these cancer-preventing products.\"The most important thing that I always want to emphasize in any of the research I'm doing is the importance of using [sunscreen],\" said Richard Blackburn, a materials scientist at the University of Leeds and Keracol Limited, UK, who researches and develops new sunscreens and skin products.\"We should be worried about skin, skin damage,DNA damage, skin aging, so the use of a sunscreen, if you're going to be out, is really, really important.\"Ultraviolet light damages skinUltraviolet (UV) light is emitted bythe sun, penetrates Earth's atmosphere and reaches the surface. And it's dangerous.\"UV damages all living things,\" said Antony Young, a photobiologist at Kings College London.UV is invisible but the damage it causes to humans when it's absorbed by the skin is obvious. Even a short-term exposure to sunlight — sometimes less than half an hour — can cause sunburn.There are two types of UV light: UVA and UVB.UVA is a longer wavelength form of ultraviolet and reaches deep layers of the skin. UVB usually penetrates the outer skin layers, such as the epidermis, and is the main cause of sunburn.Even people with darker skin tones need to be careful of UV. While natural pigmentation can provide a temporary guard against ultraviolet light, skin is skin, and damage can still occur after extensive exposure.While high-SPF sunscreens filter out most UV light, health advocates recommend covering as much of the body as possible when exposed to direct sunImage: Jordi Boixareu/ZUMA Wire/IMAGOThere are two types of sunscreensIn the 20th century, sunscreens were developed to reduce the harm caused by UV. They contain many ingredients but are generally divided into two categories based on their active properties.One of these are \"chemical\" sunscreens. But scientists are trying to move away from that description because, after all, everything on our planet is made of chemicals.The term they prefer is \"organic sunscreen\" because they contain carbon-based active ingredients. These molecules absorb and diminish UV rays when they hit the skin, helping to prevent sunburn.The other category is sometimes called \"physical\" or \"natural\" sunscreens. The active ingredients in these are chemicals too — but they aren't carbon-based. Instead, these use titanium or zinc oxide particles to provide a physical filter.Both sunscreens absorb and block UV from penetrating and damaging skin. The radiation is released as heat.While no sunscreen filters out 100% of UV, they are vital at blocking out an overwhelming amount of it. Sunscreens are rated using protective factor labels, abbreviated to SPF or UPF, indicating how much UV is filtered out.SPF15, for example, filters away 93% of UVB radiation; SPF30 filters 97% and SPF50 filters 98%.Skin cancer and the dangers of the sunTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 videoSunscreen having a moment in the spotlightHealth authorities are increasingly vocal about the importance of using sunscreen, and general sun protection, to prevent skin damage and reduceskin cancer rates.But these messages are also competing with claims, including ones circulated on social media, that sunscreen can do more harm than good. Some of these arefalsehoods misrepresenting data.There are, however, also reasonable concerns about thesafety profileof some chemicals that have been used in sunscreen for years. While these have generally been considered safe, some long-approved substances like oxybenzone, avobenzone and octinoxate have been detected in the bloodstream, and may break down into toxic compounds.The question scientists — and health regulators — are asking is, are these toxins enough to pose a danger?\"What matters is the dose,\" said Young. \"This is also true with concerns aboutsunscreen pollution into the oceans. The trouble is a lot of the toxicity studies are done with doses that are not going to be achieved, or [are] very difficult to achieve.\"Among other recommendations from dermatologists and"

DW's Jens Thurau reports on his troubled train journey from Berlin to the North Sea coast and back.https://p.dw.com/p/4y2dlA smooth train ride from Berlin to the North Sea was what Jens Thurau had booked and paid for —  but it's not what he gotImage: Soeren Stache/dpa/picture allianceAdvertisementA summer trip theNorth Seaisland of Föhr is a brilliant idea, I thought. I can switch off my news feeds and forget all aboutwars, aboutDonald Trump,far-right populismand the desolate state of German infrastructure. Once I make it to Föhr, I can just sit on the beach all day, gaze out at the sea and relax.I booked a nice hotel and decided to take the morning train directly fromBerlinto Dagebüll, the small town on the coast from which ferries depart for the island. This would be a relaxed and environmentally friendly start to the trip with my girlfriend to the Wadden Sea. Or so we thought.We should have known better. Of course, we have heard, for example, that Switzerland — where 98% to 99% of all trains run exactly on time — has stopped allowing trains from Germany to cross the border because they are notoriously unpunctual.Only 62% are on schedule. Now, passengers coming from Germany have to change onto Swiss trains in Basel, so as not to disrupt the traffic flow in our neighbor to the south.German train travelers know to expect delaysImage: Gregor Fischer/dpa/picture allianceHowever, on our trip up north, everything was fine. At first.Our train left Berlin on time, and we got as far as Niebüll. In this small town in North Frisia, the train is separated into two parts: The first travels on toSylt, the party island for the wealthy. The other goes on directly to Dagebüll with its ferry pier. Theoretically.Just before we got to Niebüll there was an announcement: \"Today, the entire train is going to Sylt. Anyone who wants to go to Föhr must get off in Niebüll and take the regional train to Dagebüll.\"That's OK, we thought, it won't upend our plans. Admittedly, getting our suitcases off the fast train and onto the hopelessly overcrowded regional train was not exactly how we had imagined the start of our vacation.There was no information on the reasons for this change in schedule, but we were unfazed. We have become accustomed to coping with the unexpected changes in itineraries and timetables ofDeutsche Bahn. There are plenty of stories about trains that have broken down, turned back or been delayed for hours, for which no one seems to be responsible.Föhr, with its sandy beach, is a popular holiday destinationImage: picture allianceFinally on FöhrWhen we eventually arrived on Föhr, everything was just what we had hoped for. We gazed at the sea.Even the fact that most pubs, bars and restaurants only accept cash payments and no credit cards was a problem only for a few international tourists. But we all know that Germany just needs a little more time to catch up with the world on technological developments. We remember former German ChancellorAngela Merkeltelling us in 2013 that the internet was \"Neuland\" (\"uncharted territory\"). That's just how it is in one of the world's leading industrial nations.The railways fit right into this picture. For decades, very little was invested in the approximately 33,500 kilometers (20,800 miles) of track. Bridges, switches and signal boxes are now dilapidated or antiquated.After a few wonderful days on Föhr, we embarked on our return journey, well rested. Again, we were scheduled to take the \"direct train\" from Dagebüll to Berlin.There was a train waiting for us at the platform. However, deja vu: it was not the fast train we expected, but the slow train to Niebüll. Locals told us it had been like this for a long time, because of staff shortages. The direct train to the capital basically no longer exists. It's still on the timetable, but what does a timetable mean to Deutsche Bahn?Jens Thurau has recovered from his train journey from Berlin to the North Sea and backImage: DWSheep on the tracksNot long into our journey, another announcement was made: A train traveling ahead of us had hit a flock of sheep standing on the tracks. We were told that a railway emergency officer, a shepherd, a hunter and other officials were \"on their way\" to the scene of the accident. No further details were forthcoming. According to the train driver, the local officials who might have more information were not available, unfortunately.Our train conductor took the initiative and called the conductor of the train involved in the accident in front of us on his mobile. It turned out that the track had been cleared.However, we were still not permitted to continue our journey. Even our helpful conductor did not know why. \"I'm going to do something I've never done before in my long career with the railway,\" he said and began to distribute gift vouchers. \"Perha"

It's a movement, and the response from across Europe and beyond proves that women's football is not only here to stay — it is setting the new standard.\"Those were the words of Nadine Kessler, a former Germany international who is now UEFA's women's football director during Euro 2025.Much of that appears undeniable: UEFA said they sold more tickets before the group stage even began than it had in the whole of Euro 2022. Social media engagements are up 55% since then, and the prize pot has increased by 156% to €41 million ($47.5 million).But, althoughPoland made their Euros bowthis year, the movement has not quite reached the rest of the east and parts of southern Europe. Despite winning their final group game against Denmark, Poland exited at the group stage, as have the only other sides ever to have qualified from eastern Europe (as defined by the United Nations) — Ukraine in 2009, and Russia five times between 1997 and theirban from international football in 2022.This stands in stark contrast to men's football, where 11 of the 24 teams at the last men's Euros, in Germany in 2024, were from the region, albeit without enormous success. Croatia (again, defined as eastern Europe by the UN) were one of those teams, and were losing finalists in the 2018 World Cup andsemifinals in Qatar four years later. Their women, on the other hand, have not yet come close to qualifying for a World Cup or Euros.Goran Ljubojevic, the former coach and now sporting director of serial Croatian women's champions ZNK Osijek, told DW that the region was always playing catch-up, with clubs only starting to add women's programs in the 1990s, and that investment in the women's game was scarce. But he also believes societal norms are holding the sport back.'People think girls should not play football'\"The cultural problem in our countries is that people think girls should not play football, that mostly they should stay home and be housewives or something,\" said Ljubojevic. TheEuropean Union's Gender Equality index, published in 2024, bears this out to some degree, with no eastern countries above the EU average.\"I don't know that it will ever happen that we will see a shift in the male brain in Croatia, and that this part of Europe will ever accept women's football on that level like they do in western Europe and or the US.\"Croatia's women's team has struggled to make much progressImage: Mirko Kappes/foto2press/picture allianceBut Ljubojevic, who played for NK Osijek (ZNK Osiek is the women's section of the club) and Dinamo Zagreb, said seeing sold-out stadiums and widespread interest in tournaments like the Euros is having an impact in his homeland, and the east and south of the continent more broadly.\"People saw the games in the European Championship, they saw theWorld Cup in Australia[and New Zealand in 2023], they saw full stadiums and were like 'Wow, I really didn't know that many people watch women's football.' So, something shifts in their mind. But even with that, I think the infrastructure is still not good enough for women's football to rise up here,\" he said.Despite being the most successful side in the country, ZNK Osijek draw crowds of only about 300 for their home matches. As Ljubojevic sees it, the talent is there, it just requires investment in coaching, infrastructure and paying players enough for them to be full-time professionals.Increasing budgets make a differenceUEFA has put new schemes into place in the region in recent years, and these are starting to have an impact, according to Dariusz Wojtaszyn, a contemporary history professor at the University of Wroclaw in Poland.\"There have been many positive developments in recent years. They are driven by initiatives of UEFA and local football associations, which, albeit slowly, are beginning to recognize the potential of women's football,\" the academic, who has written extensively on women's football in eastern Europe, told DW.\"Women's football budgets have increased significantly [usually more than 100%] in all CEE [central and eastern European] countries. That is why I view UEFA's initiatives very positively.

Loneliness has become a pressing issue in Germany, with far-reaching consequences.https://p.dw.com/p/4y2aFAccording to a recent study by the World Health Organization, one in six people worldwide feels lonelyImage: Zoonar/ImagoAdvertisementThree years ago, Felix Wunnike realized he had struck a chord with young people. Whenever the business psychology graduate posts videos on hisTikTokaccount about \"finding friends,\" his followers respond immediately.\"Even when I just said in the video, 'Send this video to your best friend,' the top comment with the most likes was always something like, 'I don't have any friends,'\" Wunnike told DW. \"I noticed that many of my younger followers feel really lonely and say that they really don't have any friends at all. That shocked me a lot.\"While loneliness can make it more difficult for adults to find a job and keep it, for young people it can affect their grades in school. Wunnike has now written a self-help book entitled \"Everything You Need to Know About Finding a Friend.\"Wunnike has identified two reasons for this trend: theCOVID-19pandemic and social media.\"Despite all the positive aspects, I think it's important to warn people about the downsides anddangers of social media usage, namely that we forget about real life. When we look at our friends' Instagram stories, we overlook the importance of building friendships in real life.\"Loneliness can lead to authoritarian thinkingAccording to a recent study by the World Health Organization, one in six people worldwide feels lonely. Among teenagers, it's even one in five. Loneliness is becoming an increasingly serious problem in Germany, according toa survey carried out by one of the country's leading public health insurerslate last year.Loneliness hurts — and that's hardwired in our brainTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 videoYoung people who suffer fromloneliness are more susceptible to authoritarian thinking, according to Claudia Neu. The sociologist has studied what happens when loneliness causes young people to stray down a path of political extremism. She led a study which examined the connection between loneliness and anti-democratic attitudes among young people in Germany, and came to a pretty discouraging conclusion.\"Young people between the ages of 16 and 23 are particularly susceptible to conspiracy theories and tend to condone the use of political violence,\" said Neu. \"It's important to note that while a statistical correlation has been found, it does not necessarily imply causality. Not every lonely person votes for the far-rightAlternative for Germany, nor does every AfD voter have elevated levels of loneliness.\"Neu has now written a book on this topic, entitled \"Loneliness and Resentment.\" Her thesis is that when people no longer feel connected to society and, worse still, react to this with resentment, there is a real potential threat to democracy. She argues that lonely people are in fact victims, having experienced discrimination much more frequently than people who are not lonely.\"They repeatedly feel rejected. They are frustrated when at a social get-together they once again fail to connect with anyone and return home feeling alone,\" she said. \"This type of rejection can generate resentment. And this they see as unfair and are unable to let it go, blaming others, and ultimately becoming bitter and angry.\"'Higher risk of loneliness' in rural areasNeu has headed the Sociology of Rural Areas department at the universities of Göttingen and Kassel since September 2016. She said living in remote areas increases the likelihood that people feel lonely, because humans depend on interaction and communication.\"If there is a lack of opportunities to meet people, then there is a significantly higher risk of loneliness,\" Neu told DW. This then changes perceptions, she said, adding that she has found that chronically lonely people perceive spaces differently.\"They see their surroundings as darker and more unsafe, they feel less comfortable both in public and in private spaces. And they are less likely to believe that their community can work well together,\" she said.Rise in single-person householdsA survey conducted by health insurer Techniker Krankenkasse showed that around 60% of people in Germany say they experience loneliness in their private lives. According to the Federal Statistical Office,17 million people in Germany live alone— that's one in five. This represents an increase of 22% over the past two decades.According to Neu, the increasing individualization of society has both positive and negative aspects. \"On the one hand, people have more freedom to choose. It has become much easier to end an unhappy partnership. On the other hand, being alone a"

First, there would be something, then nothing at all. And then something would arrive and then nothing again. It really wasn't good,\" Patrick Gröne, a resident of Hagen in western Germany, told public broadcaster ARD.He had ordered for some live ladybug larvae to fight the aphid problem blighting his house plants. But four weeks later when the much-awaited package finally arrived, the larvae were all dead.He got a replacement batch — eventually. Again, none of the larvae were alive.Another case that has been widely reported in the German media involves an 82-year-old woman who tried in vain to get an ultra-fast delivery to a North Sea island where she was vacationing. Instead of getting the mobile phone that she had forgotten at home the next day, it finally turned up six working days later.Job cuts, working conditions, profitsGermany's service sector union Ver.di and communication workers' union DPVKOM are blaming the difficulties on ongoing restructuring and waves of layoffs.And those are not expected to end any time soon. In March, Deutsche Post announced that it would be cutting another8,000 jobsby the end of the year to save a billion euros ($1.17 billion). Last year, turnover rose to €84.2 billion, but operating profits sank to €5.9 billion.DHL delivery workers are often so pressed for time that they tend to leave parcels for an entire apartment block with neighbors living on ground or first-floor flats.The company has been keen to play down the problem, saying the number of complaints is small in relation to the volume of letters and parcels transported by Deutsche Post and DHL. In 2024, it delivered more than 12 billion letters and 1.8 billion parcels.\"In a company with 187,000 employees and around 50 million items processed per day, mistakes can never be completely ruled out,\" a spokesperson told ARD.

Up to January 1, 2025, they were still obliged to deliver 80% by the next working day.So maybe it's all about expectations? Certainly, if things go on like this, Deutsche Post and DHL are set to have a record year of the worst kind, beating out 2024's total of 44,406 complaints.Edited by: Rina GoldenbergWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

These weren't just for washing — they were integrated into religious sites for purifying rituals.These Minoan ruins — with stepped water basin — date back to around 6 B.C.E.Image: John Hios/akg-images/picture allianceIn ancient Egypt, fountains often featured lion's head spouts, a motif passed down through Greco-Roman and Islamic traditions.For instance, the Court of the Lions in the 14th‑centuryMoorish Alhambra palace in Granada Spainfeatures a fountain consisting of 12 lion figures spouting water.Associated with strength and divine guardianship, lions symbolized protective power. Thus, a lion in mid-roar made an ideal candidate for visually striking spouts, especially at palaces or grand entryways.Lion heads have long been favored as fountain spouts, as seen here at the Hathor Temple in EgyptImage: Steven Heap/Zoonar/picture allianceIn traditional Islamic gardens, fountains and water features played a central role, reflecting the Quranic vision of Paradise and symbolized purity, life and divine beauty.Influenced by the Moors of the Nasrid dynasty (residents of the aforementioned Alhambra) and the Persians of the Sasanian Empire, these gardens were designed to evoke spiritual bliss and harmony by integrating, among others, fountains into their layout.Symbolism and serviceIn Europe, the Renaissance and Baroque periods transformed fountains into vehicles of spectacle and political symbolism.Leading the pack are Rome's famed fountains: Bernini's Fountain of the Four Rivers in Piazza Navona represents the four major rivers known during the Renaissance: the Nile (Africa), the Danube (Europe),the Ganges(Asia) and the Rio de la Plata (Americas). Commissioned by Pope Innocent X and built in 1651, it symbolized the global reach of the Catholic Church and the pope's power.Contributing to its fame, Rome's Trevi Fountain starred in an iconic scene in Federico Fellini’s 'La Dolce Vita' (1960)Image: Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto/picture allianceCompleted in 1762, theTrevi Fountainhas since achieved pop icon status and is now an influencer magnet, partly due to the legend that a coin tossed into it would ensure a return to the Eternal City, likely influenced by the 1954 movie \"Three Coins in the Fountain.\"In Ottoman Istanbul, public \"cesme\" or fountains were donated by wealthy families as acts of charity. Often bearing poetic inscriptions, these fountains offered water freely in a hot climate and were meeting spots for the city's residents.Modern spectaclesFast forward to the 20th and 21st centuries, and some fountains have even become iconic \"performers.\" California-based WET Design has created two such examples.The Bellagio Fountains in Las Vegas, opened in 1998, feature more than 1,000 fountains swaying to music and enhanced by light. The display spans more than 300 meters (around 1,000 feet) with water soaring as high as 138 meters. This audiovisual spectacle reportedly utilizes water from an on-site well, and not city water systems.With 6,600 underwater lights that some claim can be seen from theInternational Space Station, the Dubai Fountain located on the Burj Khalifa Lake is reportedly the world's largest performing fountain. Close to 275 meters wide and shooting water 150 meters high, its waters are choreographed to sway to Arabic classics orK-pophits.Wasteful or wise?Critics have argued that fountains waste water, especially in drought-prone regions.During drought conditions, some cities turn off their decorative fountains to preserve water resources, as was the case in Milan in 2022.Facing this problem, modern designs often use recirculated water and solar-powered pumps.Rome's drinking water fountains, the nasoni, are a welcome public service in the cityImage: Li Jing/Xinhua/picture allianceResearch has shown that fountains can have localized cooling effects — especially when they incorporate fine sprays or mist, which increase evaporative contact with air.According to the European Climate-Adapt initiative, released in 2024, \"water spray from a fo"

At aG20 meeting of finance ministers in the South African city of Durban, he emphasized that partners in the global south share an interest in stable trade relations and respect for human rights. The task was to strengthen the economic relationship between Germany and South Africa — as well as that between Europe and Africa as a whole.What if African countries integrated their economies?To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 videoA few days earlier, the Sub-Saharan Africa Initiative of German Business (SAFRI) called for a strategic reorientation. The so-called \"Africa turnaround\" was long overdue, it said. How realistic is this wish for renewal? And what is standing in the way?More competitionTrade data paints a sobering picture: German exports to the region have been stagnant for more than a decade. In 2014, they were valued at €13.3 billion ($15.6 billion), 10 years later, only €14.2 billion in German exports was traded. Accounting for inflation, the growth rate is virtually zero.Africa has no lack of economic dynamism. Countries such asTanzania,Ivory CoastorSenegalhave been recording robust growth rates for years. Demand for infrastructure, consumer goods and energy is rising across the continent, also fueled by rapid population growth. A big opportunity for German exporters.The main beneficiaries of these developments are, however, elsewhere: Companies from China, India, Turkey or the Gulf states clinch the biggest contracts. China has multiplied its exports and investments in Africa over the past 20 years. German firms, by comparison, have lost market share in many sectors.\"A new race for Africa is taking place due to the relative decline of the EU and the US,\"  according to political scientist Kai Koddenbrock from Bard College in Berlin said.The treasure in Africa's soilA key example of this is the global competition forcritical raw materials. Africa has a key role here. Whether cobalt, bauxite, lithium or rare earth: many of thesestrategically important mineralsare already being extracted from the African continent or remain untapped. They are essential for making batteries, wind turbines and electronic motors — technologies central to green and digital transformation.As global demand climbs, especiallyChinais securing access to these resources — often supported by long-tern infrastructure projects and a clear industrial-political strategy.US PresidentDonald Trumphas also begun acharm offensive.Germany, on the other hand, risks falling behind.

Christoph Kannengiesser, CEO of the German-African Business Association, doesn't think so.

Instead of mining raw materials, German interests are most focused on greenfield investments, local partnerships, and the development of sustainable structures.Many German companies are well known for implementing know-how in their African locations.

A coherent Africa strategy has so far been lacking. The latest plan was finalized shortly before the election late last year, far too late to show any effect.

We need to treat mental health issues earlier in life.https://p.dw.com/p/4y1wwLate-life depression is often undiagnosed, and often ignoredImage: Calilus Bricolage/Pond5 Images/IMAGOAdvertisementIt is perhaps the last place you would expect to find a generational divide, but even inmental health, we (those of us of a certain age) are told, \"We [those of us of a younger age] are more aware of mental health than you\" — as if awareness alone could remedy depression.There is actually some truth to this.\"There are shifts in younger generations and also in older generations. But unfortunately mental health is still very stigmatized for older adults,\" said Pascal Schlechter at the Institute of Psychology, University of Münster, Germany. \"It's quite a big step [for some people] to admit, 'I have a mental health problem and I want to talk about it.'\"But it's not only older patients who lack awareness or a willingness to talk about depression. It can also be their doctors, who may misdiagnose a mental health problem as a physical one, common when you grow old.\"If a 30-year-old tells you they've stopped going out and are withdrawing [from social interaction], you would ask them, 'Is anything wrong with your mental health? Are you depressed?',\" said Schlechter. \"But with an older person, you might say, 'You're fatigued. It's just part of the normal aging process. Just rest.'\"Is depression a real illness?To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 videoSymptoms: Is depression different for older adults?The generational divide closes when we talk about symptoms of depression — there is little to no difference in depression between younger and older adults.While at Cambridge University in the UK,Schlechter co-published a paper on the development of depressive symptoms in older adults, based on the results from a longitudinal study that tracked the progress of more than 11,000 people over a period of 16 years.Schlechter and colleagues found the same symptoms in older adults as in younger adults: Patients expressed theyfelt depressed, or thateverything was an effort, theycouldn't get going, hadrestless sleep, or feltlonely.However, they noted: \"In older adults, depression often presents with more somatic symptoms than in younger populations.\"When Schlechter spoke with DW in July, he added: \"Medical or somatic symptoms may be part of a depression, but [older adults] often misattribute these symptoms to their aging process. This can lead to delayed recognition, [and as a result] their depression may manifest more chronically.\"So, there is that difference: Whether it's due to a lack of awareness among patients and physicians, or stigma,depression can be worse for older people.That may be because the depression is combined with — or, in part, \"triggered\" by — a somatic (physical) illness, or symptoms of depression were left unaddressed earlier in life — perhaps also due to a lack of awareness or stigma.As with most illnesses the earlier depression or anxiety are diagnosed, the better the chances of treating them.Some social factors also contribute to depression. As we enter late life, we are often forced to adjust to changes in our social status, our identity through work or elsewhere in a community, and people start dying around us. We may even experience abuse from our carers, as highlighted information from theWorld Health Organization on depression— another, potential contributing factor.All these things can bring what may have been a mild, latent depression to the fore in a chronic and severe way.Treatments: Depression medication and psychotherapyThere is a sense when talking to experts in the field that physicians may prefer to tackle physical ailments in older adults than mental ones.No matter what age a person is, depression is difficult to treat. But when older adults present with both physical and mental health problems, it's even harder.\"In both poorer and richer health systems in Europe, one of the main instruments we have to deal with depression is medication,\" said Albino Oliveira-Maia, who heads theNeuropsychiatry Unit at the Champalimaud Foundationin Lisbon, Portugal.\"When treating older adults [with] medication, [there is a] higher likelihood for interaction with other medication and for toxicities [to occur],\" Oliveira-Maia told DW. \"That might mean physicians pay more attention to physical health problems than mental health.\"But medication is not the only treatment for depression — there are also a range of psychotherapy options, or so-called talk therapies, including cognitive behavioral therapy, and many others, specific to a patient's situation.How working mothers can avoid burnout and depressionTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and co"

While the boom in women's cycling continues, how does it measure up to the men's race?https://p.dw.com/p/4xytKIn 2024, Kasia Niewiadoma-Phinney (left) and Tadej Pogacar won their respective Tour de France competitionsImage: Julien De Rosa/Loic Venance/AFP/Getty ImagesAdvertisementDemi Vollering can handle disappointment. The Dutch rider lost last year'sTour de France Femmesto Poland's Kasia Niewiadoma-Phinney by just four seconds — never before has the Tour deFrancebeen decided by such a close margin. But the 2023 Tour winner is troubled by a bigger issue, namely that of inequality.Women's cycling beset by prize-money gapIn general, female professional cyclistsearn far less than their male counterparts.At the spring classic Milan-Sanremo, Vollering said the fact that the prize money was \"only 11% of that for the men\" represented \"a huge difference, and that's very disappointing. There's still a lot to do.\"This difference also exists at the Tour de France. The male winner receives €500,000 ($586,000) in prize money, while the female winner receives only €50,000. When asked about this, the director of the Tour de France Femmes reacted defensively.\"The question of prize money has been with me since the first edition of the Tour de France Femmes, and to be honest, it's a bit annoying,\" Marion Rousse told DW.When Marion Rousse was still an active cyclist, the women's side of the sport was strictly amateurImage: Loic Venance/AFP\"It's difficult to compare a race with 21 days of racing and one with nine days,\" she argued, pointing to the additional revenue from sponsorship and TV money generated by longer stage races.\"If you compare theTour de France Femmeswith men's races of a similar length, it looks different: Compared to Paris-Nice or the Criterium du Dauphine, the prize money for the women's Tour is higher than for the men's.\"This is indeed true; the winners of the Paris-Nice and the Criterium du Dauphine receive €16,000.Huge gap between top earnersThe inequality is particularly evident in salaries, as male cyclists can earn significantly more than female cyclists. According to information from the websiteCyclingnews, there is a significant gap between women and men among the top earners alone.The three highest-earning men in cycling areTadej Pogacar(€8.2 million), Remco Evenepoel (€5 million) and Mathieu van der Poel (€5 million). In women's cycling, the top three are Demi Vollering (just over €900,000), Lotte Kopecky (€900,000) and Elisa Longo-Borghini (just over €800,000). However, the salaries of the top female riders have apparently increased significantly recently.The Tour de France Femmes has also become longer — spanning nine days instead of eight for the first time. This is still fewer than half the 21 stages of the men's Tour, a point of criticism for many.Kasia Niewiadoma-Phinney (center) won the 2024 race just four seconds ahead of Demi Vollering (left)Image: Julien de Rosa/AFP/Getty ImagesRousse, however, sees the one-day extension as \"a strong message to women's cycling.\"\"Our race is still very young; it's only its fourth edition. But you can already see the development; the Tour is getting harder,\" Rousse said.Media presence has always been an important financial factor, and TV and streaming create an advertising environment. Higher ratings and social media reach generate revenue and make the event attractive to other sponsors.While the women's and men's Tours are both broadcast in 190 countries, a closer look reveals significant differences. French television shows around 20 hours of the Tour de France Femmes live on television, but a good 100 hours of the men's race. This is not only due to the race being longer, but also to the fact that the Tour de France is broadcast in its entirety, while the broadcast of the Tour de France Femmes is not.'On the right track'But the Tour de France Femmes is catching up in terms of ratings. While the men's Tour de France reaches peak audiences of 6.3 million in the host country, the women's race reached 3.5 million viewers for the dramatic finale in 2024 up to Alpe d'Huez. Interest from host cities and towns along the route is also increasing significantly.While interest in the women's race is growing, the Tour de France Femmes still has a long was to goImage: Arne Mill/frontalvision/picture alliance\"We now receive applications in 90% of cases from cities that apply for both races in the same letter: the men's and the women's Tour,\" Rousse said. \"This is a change that is taking place; we are truly on the right track.\"Another important step for the development of women's cycling was the introduction of minimum wage. Female cyclists in the top league (World Tour) must receive at least €38,000 per year, while new professionals receive just under €32,000. Here, the gap to men is smaller, with the minimum wage there"

In Germany, questions are mounting why the state is doing so little to stop them.https://p.dw.com/p/4xyuIGermany's banks have played a key role in the Cum-Ex and Cum-Cum tax dealsImage: picture-alliance/dpaAdvertisementThe scandal regarding so-called Cum-Ex and Cum-Cumtax schemesfirst broke in 2001, and still to this very day exact figures about financial losses are hard to calculate.However, the sums must be enormous given the magnitude of the fraud and what's already been uncovered by thetax authorities of various countries.According to calculations by University of Mannheim in Germany, between 2000 and 2020 aloneGermanylost nearly €29 billion ($34.1 billion) due to Cum-Cum fraud  — the \"little brother of Cum-Ex\" as the university's top financial researcher Christoph Spengel once called it. Globally, the revenue loss is estimated at more than €140 billion.What's striking is that despite these tax fraud schemes being publicly known they seem to continue.But what you often hear from the authorities is that they are \"not aware of that,\" says Anne Brorhilker.Brorhilker must know because she once was Germany's most prominent senior public prosecutorwho brought numerous Cum-Ex cases to court.Brorhilker is recognized as Germany's top expert on the complexities of Cum-Ex financial crimeImage: Oliver Berg/dpa/picture allianceSpeaking to DW, the tax lawyer by profession said she's still bound by a nondiclosure agreement with her former employee, the Cologne public prosecutor's office, and cannot discuss details of the agency's findings in public.But key whistleblowers, who are still working in the finance industry, had testified in court that these schemes are ongoing, and not only in Germany.Now working for nonprofit activist group Finanzwende (Financial Change), Brorhilker says Cum-Ex practices are relevant in Belgium, France, Italy, Austria, the Netherlands, Spain, and Luxembourg.University of Mannheim professor Christoph Spengel says Cum-Ex and Cum-Cum schemes are only possible because of a legal loophole, and understanding wherein the fraud lies is only possible when prosecutors look closer into how those deals are carried out.Share deals for profitWhen Germanfinancial institutions— such as banks or investment funds — hold shares that pay dividends, they are required to pay capital gains tax. However, they can get that tax refunded, since they already pay corporate taxes.As foreign financial institutions holding German shares are not entitled to this refund, they've invented a workaround. Foreign institutions temporarily lend their German shares to a German financial institution shortly before the dividend payout deadline.In return, the foreign bank charges a securities lending fee. The German institution now claims the tax refund, then returns the shares to the foreign owner, and the resulting profit from the refund is split between the foreign and the domestic bank.Former tax auditor Hanno Berger invented the tax deals after changing sides to become a tax advisor  for banksImage: Oliver Berg/dpa/picture allianceThe key legal loophole, Spengel told DW in an interview, is that these securities lending fees are not taxed in Germany or several other countries. In countries where such fees are taxed, Cum-Cum tax fraud doesn't exist.Spengel already warned about continuing Cum-Cum share deals back in 2016, but little seems to have changed.\"A change in the law raised transaction costs, but the real legal loophole — and thus the potential for tax arbitrage — still exists,\" he said.Spengel has repeatedly called for a straightforward legal amendment to close the loophole, and argues the government could at least try to stop the fraud by reviewing refund claims more thoroughly before issuing payments.Risk-free business for banksCum-Cum deals are still not being effectively stopped, and past deals are rarely prosecuted, claims Anne Brorhilker.\"For banks it's a safe bet, because Cum-Ex and Cum-Cum are part of what's called tech trades,\" she said, with profits being made \"purely from tax effects\" that are \"completely immune to market fluctuations.\"\"The only real risk is getting caught. And that risk stays low as long as authorities remain poorly equipped,\" she added, which was the case across Europe.According to Brorhilker, one problem is a lack of specialists who are capable of pursuing economic crimes and tax offenses. \"There's a chronic shortage of staff in tax audits,\" she said, noting that in Germany prosecution is further complicated by a job rotation practice under which staff regularly switch departments or responsibilities.\"In areas that require deep expertise, which can't be acquired quickly, this is totally counterproductive,\" said Brorhilker.Inadequate equippment is another weakness that shouldn't b"

Climate crisis, wars, inequality and reduced funding are also jeopardizing previous successes,\" reads the2024 report of the NGO Deutsche Welthungerhilfe(WHH) which was presented in Berlin on Thursday. The message sounds pessimistic, almost desperate.Despite all the adversity, the private aid organization, which relies on government support and donations, is trying to spread confidence: \"Our goal of a world without hunger remains achievable — if it is prioritized, politically willed and adequately funded,\" the report states.However, the NGO's figures show an alarming trend: 733 million people worldwide currently suffer from chronic malnutrition. Since 2019, that number has risen by 152 million. And the situation is likely to worsen further because the US and Germany, the most important donor countries, are massively reducing their budgets for development cooperation and humanitarian aid.\"Cuts lead to loss of lives. What looks like austerity measures on paper means hunger, displacement or even death for millions of people,\" WHH President Marlehn Thieme warned.

According to theUnited Nations, around 25 million people in Sudan need humanitarian aid — about half of the population.According to Mogge, working in Sudan is more dangerous than almost anywhere else. \"We still have staff on the ground, some of whom have to hide in villages and the surrounding area,\" he said.Sudan is one of the places where the international response began too late, Mogge said self-critically. That is why WHH has established what it calls a proactive humanitarian aid system to enable them to respond faster to crises and wars, as well as to the consequences ofclimate change.Mogge explained that this system enables them to make payments swiftly, \"so that people don't lose everything they own, such as livestock, money and agricultural equipment.

But how did the country help him grow?https://p.dw.com/p/4xp0vTadej Pogacar (in yellow) has once again dominated the field at the 2025 Tour de FranceImage: Jan De Meuleneir/IMAGOAdvertisementFor a country with just over 2 million people, Slovenia's success in sport is astounding. They won seven medals at the last WinterOlympics, they have one of the biggest names in theNBAtoday in Luka Doncic, and the world's best cyclist, Tadej Pogacar, also comes from the small European nation. Are Slovenia just enjoying a rare generation of gifted athletes, or is something else happening?Gregor Jurak, a professor at the University of Ljubljana who specializes in physical fitness and activity, believes there are a number of reasons why Slovenia is a great place for young athletes to grow.\"All the population is quite fit, and have also high physical literacy, so they have a lot of knowledge and they are quite motivated,\" Jurak told DW.Schools lay the foundationThis is all starts at school, where staff competency is very high. Physical education teachers are required to undergo five years of specialist training before teaching, a much higher standard than many other European nations. Slovenia also has more physical education classes, and those classes are relatively small, with a maximum of 20 kids.Sports facilities are well-developed. Girls are separated from boys from the sixth grade, which according to Jurak's research improves girls' chances of developing stronger physical fitness. The school system also works in tandem with sports clubs. All of this creates a great foundation for young people to be in good physical health.\"We also found out in our studies that mothers define the lifestyle of kids in the family. And since our mothers are quite physically active — they are among the best in Europe — they are actually passing these habits on to their kids,\" said Jurak.The reason why mothers have a greater impact than fathers? \"They are the managers of free time. They are holding all the legs of the table in the family,\" he explained.On top of all of that is theSLOfitprogram, a national monitoring system for the physical and motor development of children. It has been used annually in every elementary and high school in Slovenia since 1987.Jurak is the lead researcher on SLOfit, and told DW how the data gives parents the chance to observe their child's physical development, while teachers can use it to help children who are struggling physically. While primarily a health tool, it can also help parents find opportunities in the local community that are suited to their child's fitness levels, as well as help identify which kids are showing extraordinary ability.Lake Bled is a popular tourist destination, but Slovenia's landscape as a whole is a great place to develop as an athleteImage: Sieghart Mair/Zoonar/picture alliance'Football is not so dominant'After its split from the former Yugoslavia in 1991, sports became a large part of Slovenia's national identity, particularly winter sports. Slovenia's geographical diversity — the country has ample green spaces, mountains, hills and flatlands — has also played a role in the growth of sports. Jurak believes one of the biggest factors, however, is the fact thatfootballhasn't taken up all the oxygen in the room.\"Football is not so dominant,\" he said. \"I think this is also one of the bad sides of football because it's so much commercialized that they can run all over the other sports. In Slovenia this is not true.\"Maybe this is one of the advantages for our young athletes, because they are not exposed to such high commercialization in early periods, because this could also affect them in a really negative way, also when it comes to personal traits.\"Jurak said the country is trying to stimulate other activities, including Slovenia's most popular sport, mountaineering. Cycling is also popular, but mostly for recreational rather than competition purposes.Talent and developmentBeyond the structure and landscape of Slovenia is also the question of natural ability. According toBritish cycling magazineRouleur, Pogacar's VO2 max (the rigorous exercise test that determines the maximum amount of oxygen a person can consume during physical activity) is an astounding 89.4. The range for a Tour de France peloton rider is between 70 and 85. This leaves many wondering whether Pogacar had the gifts already, or if it was growing up in Slovenia that made it possible.For Jurak, the answer is clear: \"He's a super talent, but would [Pogacar] be such a kind of super talent without this environment? Probably not.\"Pogacar is on the verge of winning his fourthTour de France. Only four riders have won five and at 26, there is a real chance that the Slovenian star might win more than anyone ever before. Perhaps the greatest"

For LGBTQIA+ people, there are nevertheless a few things to bear in mind when traveling.https://p.dw.com/p/4xxCyWhat's it like traveling in Europe as an LGBTQIA+ person?Image: Julio Rodriguez/Westend61/IMAGOAdvertisementRights forLGBTQIA+peoplevary greatly around the world: What is punishable by death in some countries is regularly celebrated at colorful Pride events elsewhere. Even within Europe, both the legal situation and the social acceptance of the queer community vary greatly from country to country.\"Basically, the needs of lesbians, gays, trans* and everyone else in between are exactly the same as anyone else,\" emphasized Jörg Argelander. Together with Gregor Hiebel, he has been running the Berlin travel agency Overtherainbow since 1996, where he regularly advisesLGBTQIA+people on safe travel.\"I want to relax, I want to have fun, I want to meet new people and I want to be able to move around freely,\" he said, summarizing the wishes of his customers.It can therefore be useful for queer travelers to get information in advance about social norms, possible support centers and their own rights in the country they are traveling to.In addition to the original colors of the rainbow flag, the Pride Progressive Flag also includes the colors of the trans* flag as well as brown and black colors for people of colorImage: Cavan Images/IMAGOHow do European countries rank?The EU is committed to protecting LGBTQIA+ people through various provisions such as the Treaty of Amsterdam (1997), the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (2000) and anti-discrimination directives. Nevertheless, some EU member states or candidate countries are currently going in the opposite direction:Hungaryand Georgia, for example, recently removed \"gender identity\" from their equality laws.At the same time, however, there have been positive developments: As of this year, Austria's Federal Equal Treatment Act stipulates that \"gender\" includes sex characteristics, gender identity and gender expression.The Rainbow Map, compiled by the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA), is a good resource for assessing the legal and political situation of European travel destinations. As a global umbrella organization of organizations that campaign for LGBTQIA+ rights, ILGA evaluates 49 European countries each year based on 76 criteria in seven categories.Cafes and restaurants in the Marais, Paris' famous LGBTQIA+ district, are decorated with colorful rainbow flags every year during Pride and beyondImage:For the past 10 years,Maltahas taken first place in the ranking; this year, the archipelago achieved a score of 88.83%, well above the European average of 41.85% and that of the European Union (51.13%). The bottom three countries in 2025 areRussia(2%), Azerbaijan (2%) andTurkey(5%).Germany is in eighth place with 69.1%.National customs and practicesWhen preparing for a trip, however, it's also worth looking beyond the legal situation of the country so as not to unintentionally violate social norms or customs.LGBTQIA+travel guides, travel blogs, apps or eventhe website of the German Foreign Officecan be useful to learn about national customs and practices in advance.On the streets of big cities in Portugal, for example, same-sex couples are not uncommon — but the public display of affection between adults, regardless of gender, is unusual. Portugal is also one of the few European countries in which there is a self-determination law, similar to the one adopted by Germany in November 2024.LGBTQIA+ friendly travel agencies can help with preparations, as can apps, certain websites and travel guidesImage: Andrey Popov/Pond5 Images/IMAGOPrecautions for TIN* peopleFor TIN* people (trans*, inter* and nonbinary people), passing through border controls can be especially difficult. \"To be very specific: If your passport doesn't say M or F, but instead says diverse, then entering certain countries can be a problem. And the problems start with your airline ticket,\" said Argelander.It's still uncommon for airlines to offer the option of \"diverse\" on your ticket. Travelers should also be emotionally prepared for invasive questions, for example by security staff at the airport — even in 2025.\"Especially when it comes to trans* people, it's no fun being waved out of the body scanners, which happens every time. This is something that happens to trans people, and people who are not affected by this are not even aware of it,\" said Argelander.In Germany, it's also possible to apply to thedgtiassociation for a supplementary ID card, which documents all self-selected personal data and a current passport photo, thereby explaining any differences between one's appearance and the information in official documents.The ID card is intended to prevent discrimination and, following the introduction of t"

This hustle and bustle, this human energy, and the many subcultures all influenced me, even as a teenager.\"Van Gogh meets John MaduTheNigerianartist is showcased in an exhibition at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, titled \"Van Gogh x John Madu: Paint Your Path.\"Inspired by the museum's invitation to participate, Madu created 10 large-format paintings in his studio in just three months.His works draw from the museum's collection, adding a modern West African touch to motifs panted byVincent Van Goghin the late 19th century. For example, one painting shows a Black person carrying a monobloc plastic chair into the restaurant in the Parisian suburb of Asnieres, which Van Gogh painted in 1887. Madu has also created a self-portrait that features van Gogh's \"Flowering Plum Orchard (after Hiroshige)\" in the background.\"I wanted to pay my respects to the master I truly admire,\" Madu told DW.Madu's 'No Food for Lazy Man II' refers to van Gogh's 'Exterior of a Restaurant in Asnières' (1887)Image: John MaduEarly influences\"Long before I even knew who Van Gogh was, I was already familiar with his works,\" he said. There was a calendar on the wall in his parents' apartment featuring paintings of the great Dutch artist. As a boy, Madu was captivated by Van Gogh's use of color — the cornflower blue, the wheat yellow and the deep green — as well as the expressive brushstrokes. He was drawn to the trees and stars that look like little whirlwinds.Van Gogh played a crucial role in guiding Madu toward painting as a means of expressing his inner world. \"Van Gogh's world unfolds for people, allowing them to connect with him,\" he said.Madu's father also contributed to his artistic journey. Although not an artist himself, he still nurtured his son's talent. \"My father was an aesthete; he had a keen sense of style and beauty,\" Madu recalled fondly. \"He loved flowers and Versace.\"Madu and Van Gogh are both self-taught artists who developed their own unique painting style.Additionally, both were influenced by East Asian art. Van Gogh's fascination lay with Japanese woodcuts, while Madu identifies as part of  \"Generation Manga.\" Even his French bulldog is named Sasuke, a \"Naruto\" reference thatmangafans will recognize.Madu and Van Gogh are both fans of Japanese art: Here in the background is a reference to the work 'Flowering Plum Orchard (after Hiroshige)'Image: John MaduVan Gogh would undoubtedly have enjoyed visiting Lagos, particularly to experience the Yoruba art or the Nok sculptures, the oldest known art in West Africa. These works captivated European artists as early as the 19th century.\"Anyone who claims that Africans were savages should consider the avant-gardism and playfulness of this art,\" said Madu.A 'global citizen'Madu has one request for his audience: not to be called an \"African artist.\" Instead, he likes to be referred to as \"an artist from Africa.\"The Lagos-born artist identifies as a global citizen. He enjoys house music and anime series, and he admits to spending \"a lot of money\" on Nike sneakers and trendy sunglasses.When asked if his art carries a social message, Madu reflects on a particular phenomenon happening in Nigeria known as \"Japa.\" This term refers to the trend of young, educated Nigerians leaving the country.\"It's a real syndrome,\" he explained. \"I won't leave Lagos. What if everyone leaves?\" That means that whenever Hollywood stars and Japanese stock market millionaires purchase his paintings, they know exactly where to find him.This article was originally written in German.Send us your feedbackYour feedbackAdvertisement"

Whether it's the confidence of scoring 14 goals in the group stage,the adversity this squad has overcomein the last three years or having two-time Ballon d'Or winnerAitana Bonmatiand superstar Alexia Putellas running the show, their victory against Germany in the Euro 2025 semifinal on Wednesday felt unavoidable.The worst part for Germany is that their 1-0Eurosemifinal loss in extra time very easily could have ended in victory.Chances aplenty for GermanyDespite the injuries, suspensions and tired legs, Christian Wück's team pushed Spain hard. Aided by the outstanding Ann-Katrin Berger,Germany'sdefense stood tall in the face of Spanish possession. After the half-hour mark, Germany had 39 passes to Spain's 219. But Klara Bühl and Giovanna Hoffmann had the best chances to score. Spain had their moments, too, but Germany's game plan was working.The problem with game plans is that they only work if you eventually deliver. But the longer the game went on, the more chances Germany missed, and the larger a Spanish victory loomed.Germany fans took to the streets ahead of the game in Zurich on Wednesday, encouraging their fans with a bannerImage: Eddie Keogh/Getty ImagesWhen Bühl curled a free kick narrowly wide with five minutes left, the feeling it just wasn't going to be Germany's night became nearly impossible to shake. When Carlotta Wamser couldn't find a way past Spanish goalkeeper Cata Coll in stoppage time at the end of the 90 minutes, Germany's misfortune looked all but sealed.\"One small mistake, one small moment where we didn't pay attention, it hurts,\" goalkeeperBerger, who said it was her fault the goal had gone in, told ARD afterwards.And that's all it took. With both sides tiring and penalties on the cards, a poor clearance from Sydney Lohmann opened the door for Spain. A quick pass found Bonmati, who, spotting the near post open, squeezed the ball past Berger, who had been expecting a cross.\"It's so bitter to lose the game so near the end as a result of a stroke of genius,\" Wück said afterwards.Genius is the word. Afterwards, Bonmati admitted to having studied Berger's tendency to move away from the near post. The attention to detail is one thing, but drawing on it in the 113th minute of a Euro semifinal is quite another. When you consider that she joined the Spain squad later than planned because she was in a hospital bed three weeks ago battling viral meningitis, her performance is even more remarkable.On a night when Germany worked tirelessly to shut her down, the two-time Ballon d'Or winner had the final word. Bonmati scored, Spain won and will face England on Sunday in a rematch of the2023 World Cup Final.Heartbreaking end for GermanyWück had said his side would have to suffer a lot. Germany's men's captain, Joshua Kimmich, sent his support ahead of the semifinal, saying: \"Even if Spain have played a good tournament, they haven't played you yet.\" And Germany's sporting director, Nia Künzer, said the team had already proven it could compensate for red cards and injuries. But for all the resiliency this team has shown, and all it did suffer, the one thing the players couldn't compensate for was Bonmati.For Germany, there is no disgrace in losing to Spain in the semifinals of a tournament that has done nothing but boost the status of the women's game. Germany's win over France last Saturday will be remembered as one of the great nights in their history, and the support this team has gathered over recent weeks is quite remarkable.Indeed, Wück even talked about this being the beginning of a journey for a young Germany team. He called for an improvement in youth football, getting more players active in theBundesligaand for this team learning more about how to handle spells of possession in these big games.It was a short, impassioned speech about where the game in Germany can go after this tournament. It was full of solid reasoning and hope about the future, in particular Germany's chances of challenging for the World Cup title in Brazil in two years. But in the immediate aftermath of a game like this, it was a little drowned out by the disappointment of how close Germany had come and yet how far away from genius they are.Edited by: Sean SinicoJonathan HardingSports reporter and editorSend us your feedbackYour feedbackAdvertisement"

Are there ways to slow things down?https://p.dw.com/p/4xdzwHow can we fix the overexploitation of our planet?Image: Sergey Nivens/Shotshop/picture allianceAdvertisementJuly 24 marks the day where humanity has used up nature's entire budget of ecological resources for the year. That's according to the international sustainability organizationGlobal Footprint Networkand York University in Toronto, Canada.The day, which is observed annually, comes just over a week earlier thanlast year's date— mainly due to the fact that oceans can absorb less CO2 than previously reported.We are overconsuming by depleting nature's capital faster than it can replenish, which is visible indeforestation, loss ofbiodiversityand the accumulation of carbon emissions in the atmosphere. And it is part of a trend that started back in the early 1970s.Mathis Wackernagel, co-founder of the Global Footprint Network, told DW that using too many resources is driving many \"environmental ills,\" and that regularly using more than the planet can naturally reproduce has a cumulative effect.\"Even if we keep it at the same level, we increase the ecological debt that the world endures,\" he said, adding that the ensuing \"debt is measurable.\"Overconsumption is a global problemQatar,LuxembourgandSingaporewere first in hitting their respective country overshoot days back in February. TheUSwas not far behind. If everyone on the planet consumed like people in the US, resources would be depleted by March 13.GermanyandPolandland on May 3,ChinaandSpainon May 23,South Africaon July 2.Wackernagel said high income \"typically leads to higher resource consumption,\" but added that it is not the only driver.Qatar, with a desert climate with low annual rainfall and intensely hot, humid summers, relies heavily on air conditioning powered byfossil fuel energy.\"They have easy access to fossil fuels, so fossil fuel use is cheap and that has a big footprint,\" he said, adding the country also uses up a lot of resources for theenergyintensive process of desalinating seawater.Uruguay, on the other hand, is not projected to start overconsuming until December 17. It has successfully turned torenewable energyto power its grid, relying mainly onhydroelectricity,windand biomass.Sticking to what Earth can replenishAnd then there are the countries that stay within bounds of the planet's capacity such asIndia,KenyaandNigeria, among others. In order to stay within our means, theworld's ecological footprintwould have to equal the available biocapacity per person on our planet, which currently stands at about 1.5 global hectares.Biocapacity is defined as land and ocean areas that provide resources such as food and timber, can accommodate urban infrastructure and absorb excess CO2. Anything higher than the global available biocapacity per person is overexploiting resources.If humans take more resources than Earth can replenish within a year, it means we're living on ecological creditImage: Ricardo Oliveira/AFP/Getty ImagesGermany has about the same amount of biocapacity per person as the global average, but uses about three times more, Wackernagel said.While India, the world's most populous country, uses more than the country itself can renew in a year, globally speaking \"the level of consumption is less than one planet,\" he said, adding that one planet should not be the goal. \"There are also other species, so we should probably be below one planet to be robust.\"Decades of overusing are taking a tollWackernagel said we are taking resources \"far beyond what Earth can regenerate\" yet have a collective understanding that what we are doing is fine. \"But we're fooling ourselves.\"Paul Shrivastava, co-president of think tank Club of Rome, said it's time to rethink how we understand economies. \"We need to change from that extractive mindset of the economy to a regenerative one,\" he told DW.\"Mining is a kind of extraction. Oil is a kind of extraction. Once we take it out of the earth, we don't give anything back,\" he added.Wackernagel said it's not about what we need to give up, but rather how we can prepare ourselves for the future and what will be valuable then.Rather than adjusting economies to reduce overshooting, people are trying to squeeze the last bit out of the toothpaste tube, Wackernagel said.\"In the United States, where I live, I could see that many of the themes around the elections last year were very overshoot related. For example, the fear of not having enough energy,\" he said. However, the government has failed to address the problem of overshooting and instead pushed to \"drill more holes and get more fossil fuels\" out of the ground.How to push back Overshoot Day?The Global Footprint Networ"

It is an illegal drug in many places, including the United States, UK and Australia.While certain doses of these club drugs can produce a feeling of relaxation or euphoria, excessive doses can lead to symptoms of drowsiness, slurring of speech, loss of motor function, confusion and memory impairment. Overdose and toxicity are also possible.Drug regulators have also identified both drugs as the toxins of choice for offenders seeking to spike drinks, render their victims unconscious or close to that,and then sexually assault them.Because these are short-lived, tasteless and colorless drugs, it's especially difficult for those wanting to have a safe night out to know if their drink has been spiked.However, a new report published in the American Chemical Society in its journalACS Sensors,has described an innovation from aSouth Koreanresearch group that could make drug identification practically seamless.Fast, discreet test for danger drugsThere are already products that allow people to identify whether a drink has been spiked. These appear as strips that can be dipped into a drink, with a color change indicating the presence of an unwanted chemical.However, such a technique can take minutes and could leave a person vulnerable to other social dangers with such an obvious testing method.The sticker 'tattoo' changes color from yellow to red in the presence of even small amounts of GHBImage: Gyeong-Ji Kim et. alThe new rapid test developed by materials scientists funded by the South Korean government could offer an alternative.Looking like a tattoo, but in actuality a removable sticker, the new product could provide an opportunity to quickly and subtly identify the presence of GHB.Embedded in the silicone sticker film is a solution containing an iodide indicator called BHEI. When exposed to a solution containing GHB, the indicator changes from yellow to red.According to reported results, stickers changed color almost instantaneously when exposed to drops of GHB in whisky, vodka, beer or coffee.For those wearing the sticker, they would only need to expose their marker to a single droplet of their drink for the change to take place. It was sensitive enough to detect 0.01 milligrams of GHB per milliliter.\"This innovation represents a proactive and accessible solution for preventing drug-facilitated sexual assault, enhancing personal safety, and fostering a sense of control and awareness in high-risk environments,\" the authors wrote in the study.German student develops rapid test for date rape drug (2013)To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 videoPromising, but further testing requiredIt's not the first time that sensors have been developed to detect date rape drugs. More than a decade ago, a group from the National University of Singapore developed a fluorescent sensor platform that could be formed into drink stirrers and straws to indicate drinks spiked with GHB.A US startup had previously invented a quick test platform that tested for several drugs using a testing disc.But rapid testing products will likely need to be developed further before going to market.Kabrena Rodda, a forensic toxicologist at the Pacific Northwest Laboratory in the US, said some spot tests can be unreliable.\"Unfortunately, spot detection methods such as these can often have high false positive rates — that is, telling you it detected the drug when it actually is not there,\" Rodda, who was not involved in the new study, told DW in an email.\"This can lead people to avoid drinks that may be safe, which may in turn lead to an inaccurate belief that GHB is being spiked in people's drinks.\"However, Rodda said the sticker test developed by the Korean researchers was \"praiseworthy and important.\"A venture company has now been established to try and bring the product to market in South Korea.But customization and adaptability to other target drugs is currently limited.\"Since a custom mold must be made and filled with agarose gel containing the GHB chemical receptor, there may be limitations in freely designing shapes like real tattoos,\" Gyeong-Ji Kim, the study's lead author based at Sungkyunkwan University in South Korea, told DW."

China's industrial policies favor domestic suppliers, who benefit from huge subsidies, access to government contracts and favorable regulations.EU officials have said these policies have caused significant overproduction, leading to the \"dumping\" of cheap Chineseelectric vehicles(EVs) onto the EU market, harming the domestic auto sector.\"The scale of China's economy — the scale of subsidies, overcapacity and government intervention — is immense,\" Bachulska said, adding that, without \"serious action\" to protect Europe's auto industry, the EU risks \"partial deindustrialization\" within a few years.China's BYD has ramped up electric vehicle exports to EuropeImage: Andy Smulders/ANP/IMAGOThe European Union has imposed tariffs of up to 45% on Chinese EVs and demanded an end to overcapacity and reciprocal market access to ensure a level playing field for EU exporters.China, meanwhile, wants to replace EV tariffs with minimum price commitments, alongside other concessions.In April, the concerns about China's trade practices led the European Union to create an Import Surveillance Task Force to help protect the bloc's internal market, which could trigger EU anti-dumping duties or other safeguards.The task force promptly noted an 8.2% increase in China's exports to the European Union in April, compared with the same month in 2024, which it attributed to Chinese exportersdiverting US exportsto the EU, avoiding Trump's higher tariffs.China has denied giving domestic manufacturers unfair advantages and accused the European Union of protectionism. Beijing justifies favoring local producers by citing national security and economic development needs.EU firms frustrated by China's rare earth curbsWith EU negotiators unable to secure significant access to the Chinese market, China's chokehold onrare earth minerals, which are essential for clean technology, chipmaking and medical equipment, is another major point of contention.According to theEuropean Commission, the EU relies on China for 98% of its rare earth supply, as well as rare earth magnets.China introduced curbs onrare earth exportslast year, causing supply chain delays and production stoppages for EU firms. Subsequently, the value of rare earth shipments to the European Union fell by 84%, to $15.1 million (€12.9 million), in the first five months of 2025, according to Chinese customs data.At June's G7 summit in Canada, von der Leyen accused China of \"coercion\" and \"blackmail\" over the curbs, adding that \"no single country should control 80-90% of the market for essential raw materials and downstream products like magnets.\"China's government has rejected the criticism.

So what's behind the fact that the share ofundeclared workhas jumped to more than 11% of Germany's overall economic output in just one year?According to labor market expert Friedrich Schneider, who calculated this figure, the volume of undeclared work in 2024 was worth a total of €482 billion ($562 billion) — more than the entire government budget, and marking the highest level in nearly a decade.For 2025, the economist from Johannes Kepler University in Linz, Austria, projects a further rise to €511 billion, an increase of 6.1%.Schneider has been studying the phenomenon for over 40 years, and prefers to call it \"shadow economy\" rather than illegal work, he told DW.\"[Undeclared] economic activities, like repairing a car or cleaning, are legal but they're carried out without paying taxes or social contributions,\" he said, adding that legal requirements such as minimum wage laws or working time limits are often ignored in the shadow economy.The construction sector is especially prone to undeclared work, as well as hospitality and cleaning servicesImage: picture-alliance/dpa/Winfried RothermelWith a shadow economy share between 11% and 12% of gross domestic product (GDP), Germany ranks in the middle compared to other industrialized countries, according to Schneider, with  Romania topping the list with around 30%, and Greece coming in second at about 22%.When calculating shadow economy output, Schneider compares the amount of cash in circulation with official economic output figures.Tax morale declines amid poor state servicesBut what's driving the increase in undeclared work in Germany, which is Europe's biggest economy?First of all, Schneider sees a growing perception in the population at large of paying too much intaxesand contributions to the social security system, while receiving poor public services in return.\"In Germany, people increasingly notice that trains are unreliable, highways are full of crumbling bridges needing repair, leading to traffic jams and delays. When citizens feel they're getting poor public services in return for high taxes, their willingness to pay — their tax morale — goes down.\"So it's no surprise to him that many people resort to undeclared work, representing a kind \"tax rebellion of the common man.\"Social security contributions and taxes eat up about 40% of Germans' monthly wagesImage: Thomas Imo/photothek/picture allianceThe practice in Germany, however, cannot be described as large-scale tax evasion, he added, citing the example of a \"teacher who gives private tutoring\", or that of a tiler who renovates a bathroom \"off the books.\"If the tax burden is high but the state offers excellent services in return, people do accept that, Schneider noted, \"but in Germany, we face a situation where the tax burden is very high, yet the services provided by the state are often deeply unsatisfactory.\"Tax rebellion and the role of support for the poorGenerally,the shadow economy is rising when unemployment rises, when there are fewer orders for companies, no more overtime for workers, and reduced shifts.\"Then people think: 'I'm making less money from my official job, but I still want a vacation or a few extras.' And the simplest way to make up for the loss is through more under-the-table work,\" said Schneider — a pattern he saw emerging \"again and again\" during his 40 years of research. \"When the economy struggles, the shadow economy thrives.\"Germany is currently in the midst of a heated debate over government support for the poor and long-term unemployed, known as \"Bürgergeld\" or citizen's income.Currently, the citizen's income for single adults who cannot work for various reasons amounts to €563 per month for living expenses, plus accommodation and health insurance that are paid by the state.Critics argue that the citizen's income encourages undeclared work — even more so as it was raised by more than 12% on January 1, 2024, which was above wage increases and the inflation level.Schneider has estimated that the increase prompted \"between 88,000 to 100,000 people\" to give up low-paid so-called mini-jobs, with workers there now \"urgently needed.\"And while the shortage of skilled and unskilled labor in Germany is growing, the government spends more and more on social benefits, including the citizen's income.The German customs service "

Among countless Birmingham bands were Black Sabbath's heavy metal rivals Led Zeppelin.Leaving school at 15 to pursue various failed apprenticeships as a plumber and toolmaker, and also working in a slaughterhouse and a mortuary, Osbourne — who already took on the nickname \"Ozzy\" at school — soon found himself in prison for six weeks for theft.In 1968, Osbourne, a budding vocalist who had played in several local blues bands, formed a group called Polka Tulk Blues with bassist Geezer Butler, guitarist Tony Iommi and drummer Bill Ward. They soon changed their name to Earth, and then to Black Sabbath.Like the Beatles, which were a major early influence on Osbourne, Black Sabbath were able to work on their new heavy rock sound while playing a series of three-hour gigs at The Star Club in Hamburg.5 European stars and their first jobsTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 videoHaving secured a record contract, the band's early heavy metal rock riffs and dark, occult-inspired lyrics sung by their eccentric long-haired frontman were showcased on two 1970 albums, the self-titled\"Black Sabbath\" and \"Paranoid,\" which each sold over a million copies. By 1973, with the release of \"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath,\" the band, and especially Osbourne, were global superstars.Substance abuseBut amid the constant touring, Osbourne developed his infamous drugs and alcohol addiction. He recalled winding down after performances by drinking a bottle of hard spirits and taking a handful of sleeping pills. The rest of the band were also doing drugs, but by the late '70s, Osbourne was often too drunk to rehearse and write songs, and the band's output suffered.In 1979, Osbourne was kicked out of Black Sabbath for his unreliability and excessive substance abuse. However, unlike fellow English rock legends like John Bonham of Led Zeppelin, who died at 32 in 1980 from alcohol abuse, Osbourne was determined to survive his addiction.\"The day I got fired from Sabbath was at the time the worst day of my life,\" he said in an interview in the 1980s. \"But then looking back now, it was probably the best thing that ever happened to me.\"Upon leaving the band, Osbourne went into a hotel room for three months and, in his words, \"got smashed out of my brain everyday.\"But soon after, he kicked drugs and embarked on a highly successful solo career that included 13 studio albums. Up until his death, he sold upward of 40 million records.Osbourne's debut solo album, the 1981 \"Blizzard Of Ozz,\" included the US top 10 single \"Crazy Train,\" and was certified five times platinum.A year later, the heavily tattooed, eyeliner-wearing singer, whose style veered between glam and gothic, gained further infamy for biting the head off a live bat on stage during a US tour. Osbourne claimed he thought it was a toy — though he had allegedly bitten the head off two doves in front of a CBS Records PR executive the year before.Back in BlackIn 1997, Osbourne rejoined the band upon which his wild man persona was built. That same year, Black Sabbath played at the Ozzfest metal music festival that Osbourne founded the previous year with his wife and manager, Sharon. He was a regular with the old band until they recorded a final studio album in 2013 titled \"13.\" The band's final gig, billed \"Back to the Beginning,\" was performed in their hometown of Birmingham in July 2025.Sharon Osbourne, Ozzy's wife and long-time manager, organized his farewell showImage: epa/dpa/picture allianceThe sometimes incoherent singer became a kind of ageing rock caricature in the early 2000s when he agreed to mak"

Premature brain aging can affect memory, sensory function and emotional function. The authors say the brain aging they observedmay be reversible.\"The pandemic put a strain on people's lives, especially those already facing disadvantages. We can't yet test whether the changes we saw will reverse, but it's certainly possible, and that's an encouraging thought,\" said the study's senior author Dorothee Auer, a neuroscientist at University of Nottingham in the UK.Frank Slack, director of HMS Initiative for RNA Medicine and the Cancer Research Institute at Harvard Medical School in the US, said the \"work is a tour de force showing in a large population that COVID had severe effects onbrain health, especially in males and the elderly.\" Slack was not involved in the study.The study was published inNature Communications.Did the pandemic affect people's brain function?The study aimed to investigate the adverse effects ofCOVID-19on physical and cognitive brain aging using brain imaging and cognitive testing.The researchers analyzed brain scans from healthy adults taken before and after the pandemic as part of the UK Biobank study.\"[This] gave us a rare window to observe how major life events can affect the brain,\" said Stamatios Sotiropoulos, a neuroscientist at University of Nottingham and the study's co-lead author.First, the researchers used brain scan data from 15,334 healthy people to train a machine learning algorithm that could accurately estimate their brain age.They then used the model to predict the brain age of 996 healthy adults before and after the COVID pandemic.One group of participants had scans before and after the pandemic began, while a comparison group only had their scans taken before the outbreak.5 years since COVID-19 pandemic declaredTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 videoPandemic aged people's brains, even those without COVID infectionThe study revealed that the brains of participants from the pandemic group had aged an average 5.5 months faster than the control group, even when matched for a range of health markers.Jacobus Jansen, a neuroscientist at Maastricht UMC, Netherlands, said the surprising result was that \"aging is independent of actual COVID-19 infection.\"However, only participants who were infected by COVID-19 showed a drop in cognitive abilities likemental flexibility and processing speed. This may suggest that the pandemic's brain aging effect without infection may not cause noticeable cognitive symptoms.The next question researchers are aiming to answer is how the pandemic had long-term effects on people's cognitive health. Other studies have suggested certain genetic factors could make some people more predisposed to COVID-related brain aging.\"[In 2022], we described premature aging in the brains of severe COVID. Unfortunately, all of the patients we examined had passed away from COVID, precluding detailed follow-up and analysis of brain architecture over time,\" Slack said.\"It will be interesting to start to ask whether the aging effects seen in this study are related to the gene expression changes we saw in our study,\" Slack said.Can you reverse brain aging?Neuroscience studies suggest there are ways to slow down brain aging and reduce the risks of cognitive decline.Exercise, for example, is a known protective factor in brain aging, which is why \"it would be valuable to assess the contribution of changes in exercise patterns during the pandemic, alongside psychological stress, within their model,\" said Maria Mavrikaki, a neuroscientist at Harvard Medical School, who was not involved in the study.Other studies suggest that brain aging can be slowed down by lifestyle changes likeeating a healthy diet, staying physically and mentally active, managing stress and getting adequate sleep, whichpromotes healthy brain aging.These small changes can add up, so making them part of your routine can support yourbrain"

But this dot on the southernNorwegianlandscape happens to perch directly above the continent's largest deposit ofrare earth elements.These hard-to-acquire metals are crucial components of many modern technologies and appliances, from fighter jets toelectric vehicles, flat-screen TVs to digital cameras.They're so important, in fact, that having a secure supply of them has become a part ofEuropean Unionlaw. Because, right now, the EU has no internal supply of its own, Ulefoss holds promise.The hidden deposit known as the Fen complex slumbers as close to the surface as 100 meters (328 feet). It sits right below the community's schools and homes, making it a tricky and potentially controversial operation for the Rare Earths Norway (REN) mining company.Satellite image of the prospected mining area for rare earths in Ulefoss, Norway. The area encircled in red is thought to contain a large underground deposit of several rare earth elements below the town.Image: Adam Baheej Adada/Henning Goll/DWOne resident who asked not to be named said three of the sites the municipal council is exploring as landfills for the mines are currently ponds.\"For me, existing ponds are nearly holy considering theclimate problemswe have or will be having. Had this been in the 1950s when I was a boy, I could understand it, but when the plans are for 2025, I react very strongly against it.\"But Tor Espen Simonsen, REN's community liaison and a local himself, says the company has worked hard to address the villagers' concerns.\"Many people are curious towards new mining activity, hoping that this will bring back jobs and bring people,\" he said. \"And we are working very closely with local businesses to strengthen value creation locally.\"The town in southern Norway is proud to be one of Europe’s oldest industrial communitiesImage: Adam Baheej Adada/Henning Goll/DWSo far at least, the project has avoided drawing the kind of protests and local government objections that often hamper similar large infrastructure initiatives. The town's past lends itself to this support.Mining is a known quantity for UlefossUlefoss is one of Europe's oldest industrial communities, with a history of iron mining dating back to the 1600s. The last pit shut down in the 1960s, as smaller operations in Norway lost ground to the forces of globalization and international trade.\"Growing up in Ulefoss, many people have said that one day there will be new mining activity,\" Simonsen said. \"We just don't know when.\"Tor Espen Simonsen walks towards an old mine that is close to the rare earths deposits that could soon be tappedImage: Adam Baheej Adada/Henning Goll/DWBut if REN's project proceeds as planned, that day might not be too far off and could become the community's most significant chapter of mining activity. The company says it has identified 9 million tons ofrare earth oxides, which puts the deposit on a similar scale to the world's largest active mines in China and the United States.The company hopes to begin full-scale operations in 2030, but it can only extract these rare earth elements if it can do so without affecting or displacing the village above.To do this, REN is planning to create what it calls an \"invisible mine.\" Starting about 4 kilometers away from the town center, it will dig a long, narrow diagonal tunnel directly into the heart of the Fen deposit. Using automated drills, it will then dig out giant, 300-meter-by-50-meter sections of the deposit.That material will be dropped into a crusher directly below the point of excavation. Once pulverized, that will be sent back to the surface on conveyor belts to be separated at the processing site, which will be built near the entrance to the tunnel.How will the underground mining impact the village?The risk with this approach is subsidence. The newly created empty space below ground could cause geological instability, as was the case inSweden'smost northerly town, Kiruna.TheKiruna iron ore minehas left the urban center above it with cracks and ground deformation. So in the early 2000s, it was decided the town would need to permanently relocate, a process  that is currently underway. That experience hasn't gone unnoticed in Ulefoss.\"There are some people who have seen things from other places. They're scared that our houses will fall in a big crater, or that something will be destroyed,\" said local resident Eli Landsdal. \"But I feel now w"

But does the threat of rising US inflation and retaliation make sanctions a safer choice?https://p.dw.com/p/4xTZWMany analysts think tariffs will remain Trump's go-to tool to pressure the rest of the worldImage: Alex Brandon/AP/picture allianceAdvertisementUS PresidentDonald Trump'sreliance on tariffs rather than sanctions has been described as both the \"world's worst bet\" and \"a powerful proven source of leverage\" to protect the national interests of theUnited States.While tariffs essentially are taxes on imports to protect domestic industries, sanctions are penalties imposed on other countries to punish or influence their governments. Sanctions typically restrict trade or finance.Since his return to the White House in January,Trump's tariffthreats against dozens of countries have created great uncertainty among US businesses and global trading partners.What's become known as \"tariff tango\" — bold pledges of steep duties on foreign goods, followed by abrupt reversals — suits Trump's shifting political or economic goals. Yet, financial markets remain on edge, not knowing how or when the president may deploy tariffs next.The tariff onChina, the biggest economic and military rival to the US, reached historic highs in April, soaring to 145% before being significantly cut the following monthafter trade talks in London.Trump's sudden increase and later rollback of tariffs show how he uses them as a flexible way to fix what he sees as unfair trade, based on past trade disputes.\"What shapes the president's views is the rapid rise of Japan in the 1980s and the feeling that the Japanese were out-competing the iconic American car industry because the US has been too generous in its trade terms,\" Jennifer Burns, associate professor of history at Stanford University, told DW.Trump's tariff threats: Using trade as a weapon?To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 videoHow Trump views and uses tariffsTariffs are Trump's preferred weapon to tackle the massive US trade deficit, particularly with China, which amounted to $295 billion (€253 billion) in 2024, according to the US Census Bureau. They also align with his \"America First\" agenda to protect domestic industries and boost US job creation.The White House has defended the president's approach, insisting that tariffs can be quickly deployed and, unlike sanctions, don't completely shut foreign markets to US firms.\"[Trump] can add this pressure when he wants and then bring it back when markets start to freak out or it stops serving his purpose,\" Sophia Busch, associate director of the Geoeconomic Centre at the Atlantic Council think tank, told DW. \"This is much easier with tariffs than with sanctions.\"Although tariffs have been widely criticized for their potential to stokeinflation, they do raise revenue for the US Treasury, unlike sanctions. US tariff revenues are up 110% to $97.3 billion (€83.2 billion) in the first half of the year compared to the same period last year. Tariffs are expected to raise $360 billion next year, according to the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.Tariffs give Trump direct, unilateral control, using executive orders without needing approval from the US Congress. Sanctions, on the other hand, often require complex legal frameworks and cooperation with international partners, like theEuropean Union.The preference for tariffs over sanctions reflects Trump’s aim for rapid, visible economic leverage, but raises concerns about the destabilizing effects of such policies on global trade and peace.\"The reason [tariffs] have such a bad reputation is because they're linked to these episodes of de-globalization, and in the 20th century, they were linked to armed conflict,\" said Burns. \"If low tariffs and open markets knit countries together in a way that forestalls armed conflict, does it mean that we might be moving away from that?\"Trump blurs the line between tariffs and sanctions\"Sanctions are more about punishing countries for violating international norms,\" Stanford's Jennifer Burns told DW. \"They're in response to specific actions, and if those actions cease, the sanctions can be undone.\"Trump's second-term policies suggest he is using tariffs to achieve objectives typically associated with sanctions, such as pressuring countries likeCanada,Mexicoand China on nontrade issues like immigration and drug trafficking. These tariffs have prompted retaliatory measures or threats, which haveintensified global trade tensions.Similarly,Colombia was threatened with tariffsafter it rejected US deportation flights, whilethreatened levieson the European Union were partly announced as a response to EU privacy and climate regulations.Earlier this month, Trump threatened to impose a50% tariffon imports fromBr"

We like to tell ourselves it's to socialize, for work, or to read the news. But most of us are addicted, and we know it.You can test whether you are on theSmartphone Addiction Scale here.How prevalent is smartphone addiction? Study after study confirms that people are becoming increasingly addicted to smartphones — in every country tested, and in all ages.In the US, for example, nearly 57% of those asked in a recent surveyadmitted to being addicted to their phones.\"There is evidence that problematic smartphone use impacts negatively on the lives of many people. There are associations between problematic smartphone use and mental health symptoms, such as depression and anxiety,\" said Zaheer Hussain, a social scientist at Nottingham Trent University, UK.People aregetting tired of their smartphone behaviors— as is often the case with an addiction.But the hard part is that people wanting to beat smartphone addiction can find it as hard as those whowant to quit smoking— it's a difficult psychological battle. Social apps, boredom, or simple daily habits can have you reaching for your phone often without realizing it.But the long-term health benefits of reducing your smartphone habits are huge.Studies show smartphone addiction is linked with a range of health issues, including sleep disturbances, eye strain, physical inactivity, and neck and back pain. Mentally, it contributes to depression, anxiety, loneliness, and impacts attention and memory,especially in teenagers.Smartphone addiction can also be caused by those very same mental challenges.

But the whereabouts of its treasures remain a mystery.https://p.dw.com/p/4xiMaPirate stories from the 18th century still fascinate many today, especially when it comes to lost treasures.Image: TerranoaAdvertisementA vital piece of a 300-year-old mystery surrounding a pirate's treasure in the Indian Ocean may have been discovered.Archaeologistsbelieve that they have identified the wreck of theNossa Senhora do Cabo(Our Lady of the Cape), a Portuguese warship that was captured off the island of Reunion in 1721.The ship had been en route toLisbon, fully laden with treasures from Goa and the Portuguese colonies on the west coast of India. On the way, the warship, weighing more than 700 tons, was badly damaged in a storm. To avoid capsizing, the crew jettisoned some of the ship's cannons, making the ship easy prey for the French pirate Olivier Levasseur, known as La Buse (The Buzzard).The unwieldy Portuguese warship would have been an easy target for piratesImage: Alberto Cutileiro/WikipediaWreck found near Nosy BorahaHuge quantities of gold, silver, pearls, diamonds and other valuables such as fine textiles and spices are said to have been on board.According to Smithsonian Magazine, the trove would be worth an estimated $138 million (€119 million) today.The high value of these items was likely representative of the ship's important passengers: Portuguese Viceroy Luis Carlos Inacio Xavier de Meneses, and the Archbishop of Goa, Sebastiao de Andrade Pessanha, who were taken hostage. The viceroy was later released for ransom, while around 200 slaves from Mozambique and the crew were presumably released on the island of Reunion.The old cannons in the port of Saint-Denis were once intended to keep enemies and pirates away from the island of ReunionImage: Michael Runkel/robertharding/picture allianceThe pirates then made off with their magnificent booty towardsMadagascar, off the southeastern coast of Africa. They are thought to have hidden on the small island of Nosy Boraha, called Ile Sainte-Marie at the time.The island was an ideal hideout forpirates. Around 60 kilometers long and five wide, and with a natural harbor, it was relatively close to the popular trade route between Europe and Asia, but at a safe remove fromcolonial control. And Nosy Boraha is exactly whereBrandon Clifford and Mark Agostini from the Center for Historic Shipwreck Preservation in Massachusetts believe they found the wreck of the Nossa Senhora do Cabo, hidden under silt and sand.Painstaking salvage workClifford and Angostini described their findings in the June issue ofWreckwatchmagazine. It took 16 years for their team to identify the wreck. They analyzed the ship's construction and historical records to compare parts of the wreck and artifacts that were uncovered. Clifford's social media channels offer impressions of this painstaking work, such as the example below, showing the team's exploration of the slave shipWhydah Gally, which was captured by pirates in 1717.In all, the archaeologists lifted around 3,300 artifacts from the seafloor, including gold coins and valuable porcelain, as well as sacred objects made of ivory and wood, such as a statue of the Virgin Mary and a crucifix.According to the team, there are between 7 and 10 wrecks near the island of Ile Sainte-Marie, which suggests the treasure hunt will continue.A cryptic message before executionLa Buse's booty, however, remains the biggest mystery. It is known that the pirate sailed from Ile Sainte-Marie towards the Seychelles, where he hid for around eight years. After turning down an offer of amnesty because he didn't want to return the treasure, he was finally found, handed over to the French, and taken in chains to the island of Bourbon, now called Reunion.Shortly before his execution, La Buse is said to have told his guards: \"With what I have hidden here, I could buy this whole island.\" Legend has it that the pirate threw a note with a cryptogram into the crowd, saying: \"My treasure to the one who understands this!\"As is so often the case withpirate stories, many legends surround the actual events. The only thing that is certain is that adventurers have searched in vain for the fabled treasure for some 300 years.Whether the cryptogram was actually written by La Buse also remains unclear. Although it has now been more or less deciphered, no one has yet been able to correctly interpret the enigmatic content. Does the text describe a kind of star compass? Does it describe prominent landmarks? The guesswork continues.With the treasure of La Buse still lost to this day, somewhere between the Seychelles, Reunion Island,Mauritius, Mayotte, Rodrigues and Sainte-Marie, the pirate's mystery is likely to live on.This article was originally wri"

Vibrio bacteria thrive at popular bathing sites like the Baltic Sea. Here's how to protect yourself.https://p.dw.com/p/4xYf0The Baltic See, a popular summer destination for swimming, is a perfect place for Vibrio bacteria to thriveImage: Stefan Sauer/dpa/picture allianceAdvertisementWhat you need to knowVibriosis is caused byVibriobacteria, which live naturally in brackish, warm, low-salinity coastal watersTypical European locations include the Baltic Sea, North Sea and Black SeaClimate changemay be leading to more favorable conditions forVibriobacteriaSymptoms include: diarrhea, stomach cramps, nausea, feverProtect yourself by avoiding raw or undercooked shellfish, and don't swim in these waters with open woundsScientists attribute a lot to climate change these days — with some things being easier to prove than others.When it comes toVibriobacterialinfections, there appears to be a strong link — becauseVibriobacteria thrive in warm waters, especially when salt levels are low.And in the Baltic Sea, sea surface temperatures are indeed going up, while salinity levels are going down, which researchers have linked to the effects of climate change.As sea temperatures rise, so do the numbers ofVibrioinfections in Nordic countries bordering the Baltic Sea.Vibrioinfections remain relatively rare, but health agencies like the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control warn of increased risks ofVibrioinfections duringsummers with extended heatwaves.What is vibriosis?Vibriobacteria cause vibriosis andcholera. For the purpose of this article, we are focusing on vibriosis, which is sometimes referred to as vibriosis (non-cholera).Vibriosis is an infection that can become serious and life-threatening, especially among people with weakened immune systems.The main types ofVibriobacteria that cause human infection areVibrio vulnificus,Vibrio parahaemolyticus, andVibrio alginolyticus, but there are at least a dozen types.SomeVibrioinfections can lead to the death of flesh around an open wound (known asnecrotizing fasciitis).Rarer types ofVibrio vulnificusinfections can cause serious illness, requiring intensive care or limb amputation.In the US, about 1 in 5 people die within two days of contracting aVibrio vulnificusinfection, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC estimates around 80,000 illnesses and 100 deaths fromVibrioinfections annually in the US.How do you get vibriosis?Most people get vibriosis in the gut by eating raw or undercooked shellfish, such as oysters, mussels and clams. You can also get it by swallowing water when swimming in infected coastal waters.You can also get a blood infection when bacteria enter the body through cuts to the skin, either when swimming or, for example, when on land, water from shellfish drips onto an open wound.People with pre-existing conditions may have a higher risk of infection. This includes people with liver damage through hepatitis, liver disease, excessive alcohol or drug use. But also people withcancer,diabetes,HIV— those on immune-suppressing therapies — or those taking medicine to reduce stomach acid.Vibriosis cannot be transmitted from one person to another.How do you protect yourself against vibriosis?To avoid vibriosis, do not eat raw or uncooked shellfish.Health agencies also recommend avoiding swimming in brackish waters or saltwater if you have open wounds. And if you get a cut while swimming, leave the water and have it cleaned and properly dressed.If you have an existing condition, know yourimmune systemto be compromised, or have recently had any surgery and want to swim in a coastal area, check with your doctor for appropriate advice.What are the symptoms of vibriosis?The symptoms of vibriosis depend on the type of infection. But, generally, they are similar to those of most other common infections, likeinfluenzaor an upset stomach:DiarrheaCrampsNauseaVomitingFeverChillsSigns of a bloodstream vibriosis infection include extremely low blood pressure and blistering around skin lesions. AndVibriowound infections can cause symptoms like redness, pain, swelling and weeping wounds.Where are vibrio bacteria most common?In Europe, theBaltic Seais a prime location forVibriobacteria. That affects people in coastal areas of Denmark, northeastern Germany, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Sweden, Lithuania, Poland and Russia.In theNorth Sea, the bacteria live around the Dutch and Belgian coasts. And towards southeastern Europe, they are concentrated in theBlack Sea, affecting people in Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey and Ukraine.The total number ofVibrioillnesses in Europe annually is in the hundreds. A significant spike was observed in 2018, when 445 cases were reported.North America and Southeast Asia are simila"

But she said on Saturday that she still has improvements to make.\"In moments like that, nothing goes through my head. I go to my spot and wait for the referee to blow her whistle.

Is this an isolated case — or a warning sign for the entire industry?https://p.dw.com/p/4xZdQBig steelmaker ArcelorMittal pulled out of Germany's ambitious plan to make the industry carbon-neutralImage: Schoening/Bildagentur-online/picture allianceAdvertisementSteel is the backbone ofGerman industry— but it's also a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for nearly 7% of Germany'sCO2 emissions.As Germany has pledged to become carbon-neutral by 2045 — five years earlier than the rest of theEuropean Union— the steel industry must cut up to 55 million metric tons of CO₂ annually, which is roughly 30% of all industrial emissions, according to the German Steel Federation lobby group.German steelworks, like the one seen here in 1997, still emit massive amounts of carbon dioxide.Image: picture-alliance / dpaIn order to make German steel production significantly more sustainable, the previous government comprising the Social Democrats, the environmentalist Greens and the pro-business FDP had embarked on policiesencouraging the use of hydrogenwith huge state subsidies.Green hydrogen produced withrenewable energyis planned toreplace coal in the industry.Why ArcelorMittal pulled plans for green steel in GermanyOne of the steelmakers who had initially applied for government subsidies was Luxembourg-based steel conglomerate ArcelorMittal, under a corporate plan that intended to make the company's two German steel works carbon-neutral by 2050.The German government supported the plan, offering €1.3 billion ($1.5 billion) in subsidies to facilitate the transition tohydrogen-based steelmaking.But in June, ArcelorMittal announced it was halting the decarbonization plans at its sites in Bremen and Eisenhüttenstadt, and that it would hand back the subsidy grant.\"There has been slower than expected progress on all aspects of the energy transition, including green hydrogen not yet being a viable fuel source and natural gas-based DRI production not being competitive as an interim solution,\" ArcelorMittal Europe said in astatement.The company's Europe CEO Geert Van Poelvoorde added that the European steel market is currently under \"unprecedented pressure, with weak demand and high levels of imports.\"Billions in subsidies likely not enoughThe pullout of ArcelorMittal from the German green steel plan highlights the risk for companies to fully embark on agreen transition course.The €1.3 billion in German state money were primarily intended to cover the massive upfront costs of building new production facilities. But that's only part of the problem.Using green hydrogen in steel production — produced by the electrolysis of water, using renewable electricity mainly from wind and sun —  is still more expensive than grey hydrogen based on natural gas or coking coal.Green transition poses risks to European steelmakersTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 videoYet, green steel must ultimately compete on global markets with cheaper, conventionally produced steel. And while changes in global coal prices affect all steelmakers equally, says Stefan Lechtenböhmer, switching to hydrogen-based production means \"entering a completely different market.\"\"Hydrogen is produced locally, and long-distance transport is still very difficult today,\" the professor at the University of Kassel in Germany told DW, adding that green hydrogen requires large amounts of electricity, meaning that local power prices directly impact its cost.Germany's hydrogen target a pie in the sky?But the issue isn't just cost; supply is also a major challenge. German steelmakers will need a reliable and sufficient supply of green hydrogen, a portion of which is supposed to be produced domestically.The use of hydrogen is rising in Germany, but domestic supply is unable to meet demand.Image: Max Brugger/REUTERSAccording to Germany'sNational Hydrogen Strategy, the country aims to build up 10 gigawatts (GW) of electrolyzer capacity by 2030 to produce green hydrogen.But that target appears to be wishful thinking, because as of February 2024, Germany had just 0.066 GW of installed electrolyzer capacity, data from the government'sEnergy Transition Monitoring Reportshows.\"It's almost impossible to meet the 2030 target now,\" Martin Wietschel, energy expert at the Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research, told German ARD public television recently.Hydrogen imports essential but inefficientEnergy experts agree that most of the hydrogen Germany needs will have to be imported from other countries, which is why the government has revised its strategy, now assuming that between 50% and 70% of the projected 2030 demand will have to be sourced from abroad.Be"

Once they enter the environment, they remain there \"forever.\"Scientists have established a link between PFAS and liver and kidney damage, increased cholesterol levels, diseases of the lymph nodes and reduced fertility in men and women. According to the German Federal Environment Agency, it also leads to low birth weights in babies, can reduce the effectiveness of vaccinations and cause cancer in high concentrations.Thechemicals are considered a global problemand can be detected almost everywhere.In 2018, scientists at Harvard University found that 98% of US citizens have PFAS in their blood. Studies on breast milk in countries such as India, Indonesia and the Philippines detected the substances in almost all samples. In Germany, too, every child has forever chemicals in their bodies. A fifth of them exceed critical levels.From the atom bomb to the platePFAS were discovered in 1938 by the American chemical giant DuPont. Due to their special properties of protecting metal from corrosion even at high temperatures, the chemicals were first used in the development of the atomic bomb.PFAS were used in the development of the atomic bombImage: Ales Utouka/IMAGOThe substance later found its way into households worldwide under the brandname \"Teflon\" in the form of coated pans. This marked the beginning of the commercial rise of the chemicals, which proved to be useful for many products.With their unique resistance to heat, water and dirt, they are used in a wide range of consumer and industrial products. They can be found in everything from waterproof outdoor clothing, makeup and stain-resistant carpets to medical devices, semiconductors and wind turbines.The chemicals, which are mainly ingested through drinking water and food, accumulate in the body over time. In addition to breast milk and blood, they can also be detected in hair.Decades of concealing the dangerIn 1998, the non-stick coating of Teflon was clearly scratched when a hundred cows belonging to a cattle farmer suddenly died near a production facility in the US city of Parkersburg in West Virginia.It was later revealed that thousands of people in the region were contaminated by a leaking dump and wastewater from the DuPont factory that contained PFAS.PFAS: The secret toxins in your bodyTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 videoDocuments show that DuPont, unlike government authorities, had known about the danger for decades but continued to discharge the substance into the environment. Studies suggest that high levels of PFOA (a specific PFAS substance) in the region are linked to cases of kidney and testicular cancer.In 2017, DuPont and the now-spun-off company Chemours agreed to pay $671 million (€574 million) in compensation to 3,550 people affected.Europe plans a phase-outPFAS are still being released into the environment. The US environmental organization EWG has calculated that almost 10,000 locations across America are contaminated with the substances. This is based on measurements by the US Environmental Protection Agency, among others. It is estimated that around 160 million people could be affected nationwide.In Europe, 23,000 sites are known to be contaminated with PFAS. According to the European Environment Agency, 2,300 of these are so heavily contaminated that they pose a health risk.In Alsace, France, the authorities are currently warning people not to drink tap water after checks revealed elevated levels of 20 forever chemicals.A manufacturere in Dalton, which is sometimes referred to as the 'carpet capital of the world',"

Queer identities aren't just a modern phenomenon. Here's a look at LGBTQ+ history through time.https://p.dw.com/p/4xQGsThere's an uncanny resemblance between da Vinci's John the Baptist and his Mona Lisa: Were they modeled after the same person?Image: public domainAdvertisementIn 1476, a youngLeonardo da Vinci(1452-1519) was investigated by the Florentine moral authorities. Someone had anonymously accused him of fornicating with a 17-year-old sex worker. But the charges were dropped because of a lack of evidence.German literary historian Dino Heicker, the author of a book about the history ofqueerness,\" says there are contemporary sources that prove Leonardo loved men and was particularly taken with an apprentice 28 years younger than him named Gian Giacomo Caprotti, whom he nicknamed Salai (\"little devil\"). They lived together for many years.Did da Vinci paint his lover Salai as 'Monna Vanna'?Image: picture-alliance/akg-images/A. HeldA few years ago, Italian art historians thought they had found proof that the world-famousMona Lisawas not a depiction of Lisa del Giocondo, the wife of a Florentine merchant, but of Caprotti instead. He modeled for da Vinci several times and researchers say that the resemblance is unmistakable. Additionally, the letters L and S (for Leonardo and Salai) can even be seen in the eyes of the Mona Lisa, as well as the endearing words, \"mon salai,\" which could also be an  anagram of \"Mona Lisa.\"But theLouvre Museum, where the world-famous painting hangs, isn't convinced of the theory? Da Vinci and his companion took their secrets to their graves.In 1550, Leonardo's first biographer, Giorgio Vasari, wrote that the painter took \"peculiar pleasure\" in the beautiful boy, the word \"peculiar\" functioning as a euphemism for da Vinci's queerness.The biblical city of Sodom as a den of iniquity\"When a majority defines what is normal and abnormal and declares a binary gender model to be the norm, this creates a difficult environment for minorities who feel differently,\" Heiker says.In his book, he lists some of the draconian punishments that were inflicted upon queer, non-binary or transgender people in the past. They were accused of indulging in what was referred to at the time as an \"unnatural\" lifestyle and at times put in chains, stoned, castrated or even burned at the stake. Those meting the punishment sometimes used the Bible to legitimize their persecution of queer people, especially the biblical story of Sodom and Gomorrah — these cities were destroyed by God because of \"sinful\" behavior. The term \"sodomy\" has also been used as a synonym for homosexuality.This story \"provided the blueprint for centuries of stigmatization toward other kinds of people.\" In 1512, the Spanish conquistador Vasco Nunez de Balboa ordered his dogs to maul Indigenous people in America, accusing them of having committed \"the horrible sin of sodomy.\"Dino Heicker spent two years writing his bookImage: Dino HeickerVarieties of love in antiquityOn the other hand, there were also societies in which many forms of queerness were generally accepted. For example, during antiquity, it was common for men to have a male lover in addition to wives. The Roman emperor Hadrian was so heartbroken by the death of his beloved Antinous that he had him posthumously declared as a god, and erected numerous statues and places of worship to honor the beautiful youth.The Greek philosopher Aristotle (384-322 BC) said that lawmakers on the island of Crete had come up with something very special to celebrate new births: pederasty, or \"boy love,\" when an older man took a young man into his home to train him sexually. \"Sexual favors were expected from the younger man, but this was not viewed disparagingly by society,\" explains Dino Heicker.Love between women was also commonplace. On the island of Lesbos, the poet Sappho paid homage to the beauty of the female form in her verses. And models for a variety of different kinds of love were found in the world of the gods — especially Zeus, the father of the gods, and the epitome of queerness. This term did not exist at the time, but he transformed himself into women, animals, and even a cloud in order to have sex with the object of his desire.Wall painting from Pompei: Zeus, father of the gods, approached the king's daughter Europa in the form of a bull and abducted herImage: Tristan Lafranchis/akg-images(picture-allianceIn ancient times, there was nothing considered wrong with men having sex with other men or boys, \"as long as they played the active role,\" says Heicker. \"The penetrated man, i.e. the inferior man, was considered effeminate and was considered socially inferior.\" In theRoman Empire, people liked to accuse their political opponents of being sexually passive, because \"it was a way of tarnishing their honor.\"A 'crime against nature'The spread of"

Bloody conflicts and power-hungry figures take the stage by storm — but the festival hopes for light at the end of the tunnel.https://p.dw.com/p/4xZClThe Salzburg Festival attracts large crowds annuallyImage: Salzburger Festspiele/Andreas KolarikAdvertisementTheater is a reflection of the human experience, with all its emotions and conflicts. That's why the team behind this year'sSalzburg Festival, led by artistic directorMarkus Hinterhäuser, has put together a program that embodies the crises happening around the world. Bloodshed and power struggles are thus dominating not only events in the world today but also the festival itself (July 18 to August 31). The program spans brutal rivalries from antiquity to theFirst World War.Power in focusThere have always been people likeTrumpandPutin, says Hinterhäuser. The lust for power has been part of world history.Thus, it comes as no surprise that power, that universal drug, has inspired numerous operas.Festival director Markus HinterhäuserImage: Barbara Gindl/apa/dpa/picture allianceFor instance, George Frideric Handel's \"Giulio Cesare in Egitto\" about Roman general Julius Caesar will be staged, just like Gaetano Donizetti's \"Maria Stuarda,\" which is dedicated to Scottish queen, Mary Stuart.Mozartis represented with his opera \"Mitridate, re di Ponto,\" about the ruler of the fallen empire of Pontus in Asia Minor, andVerdi's\"Macbeth\" tells the story of the royal army commander and later Scottish king. And finally, \"The Last Days of Mankind,\" a play based on Karl Kraus' disturbing book, deals with the horrors of World War I.The rulers of the past have one thing in common: Their power is crumbling. And each reacts differently to the inevitable end — whether with rigidity, fear, despair or a choleric attempt to escape fate. Opera, musical theater and stage plays act as a magnifying glass, illuminating the various scenarios of their demise. \"This gives us, the audience, the opportunity to act,\" says Markus Hinterhäuser. The performing arts open up \"spaces of change, of transformation.\"A program for 'Everyman'The festival's website says that around 222,500 tickets are available fora total of 174 opera, drama and concert performances.Musical theater is traditionally the program's flagship, and this year it features 12 productions ranging from Baroque to contemporary works.With both unconventional and traditional performances by big-name soloists — such as the annual production of \"Jedermann\" (or \"Everyman\") on the steps of the Salzburg Cathedral — the festival remains true to the guiding principle established over 100 years  ago by theater producers Max Reinhardt and Hugo von Hoffmannsthal: To offer something for everyone.A majestic backdrop for 'Jedermann': The Salzburg Cathedral also serves as a stage for the festivalImage: Franz Neumayr/picturedesk.com/picture allianceAmong others, director Peter Sellars and conductor Esa-Pekka Salonen leading the Vienna Philharmonic orchestra will present a daring new production titled \"One Morning Turns into an Eternity.\" They will combineArnold Schoenberg'smonodrama \"Erwartung\" (Expectation) with the \"Der Abschied\" (The Farewell) from Gustav Mahler's symphony \"Lied von der Erde\" (Song of the Earth) — Schoenberg's role model.There is also the play \"The Blizzard,\" based on a book by Vladimir Sorokin, a well-known Russian writer who fled from Putin and his followers. In a deadly storm, his hero, a young doctor, searches for light and hope.Theodor Currentzis works both in the West and in RussiaImage: Getty Images/AFP/S. de SakutinEven the Greek conductorTeodor Currentzis, a controversial figure on account of his dual Russian citizenship and his unwillingness to distance himself from Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, will be back in 2025 with his Utopia Orchestra, an ensemble that Currentzis founded specifically for performances in the West.Many Russian artists — but not DavydovaIn December 2024, the scandal surrounding the dismissal of Russian festival director Marina Davydova overshadowed the presentation of the Salzburg program. The dramaturge — who is also a vocal critic of the Putin regime — was dismissed for breach of contract: Davydova had worked for another festival without informing nor getting authorization to do so from the Salzburg Festival.Apart from that, the festival program shows a great deal of solidarity with artists who have turned their backs on Putin's empire: for example, Russian directorsKirill Serebrennikov(Sorokin's \"The Blizzard\"), Dmitri Tcherniakov (Handel's \"Giulio Cesare in Egitto\") and Evgeny Titov (Chekhov's \"Three Sisters\" in the version by the recently deceased Peter Eotvos) are all participating in Salzburg.Kirill Serebrennikov is a sought-after director – from Cannes (photo) to SalzburgImage: Genin Nicolas/ABACA/picture alliance\"I ma"

InEstonia, the first step of the uncomfortable undertaking can be made in less than a minute — and even without the undesired spouse being present.\"It takes 45 seconds to get to the point where it says submit the divorce application,\" said Luukas Ilves, until last year the Estonian government's chief information officerIlves told DW that divorce application was the last section of public administration that had yet to be digitized, which means the small Baltic state bordering Russia is probably the first fully digitized country in the world.Estonia's digital administration platforms are easy to access and even offer their services in EnglishImage: eesti.eeEven in Estonia, both partners must of course consent to the procedure and be physically present in a meeting with a civil servant who formally ends the marriage. But uptake of the online service is already phenomenal, with about 60% of all divorces in Estonia being initiated via the government's so-called e-divorce platform since its launch last December.\"We all expect convenience, simplicity and security from digital services in the private sector. Why should government services be any different?\" said Ilves.User-friendliness is key to acceptanceIlves is the author of a recentstudytitled \"The End of Bureaucracy,\" which he compiled in collaboration with the Friedrich-Naumann-Foundation, which is affiliated to Germany's Free Democratic Party. The report highlights the differences in digitization policy and what Germany can learn from the more advanced Estonia.Currently, about 62% of Germans use digital service in administration, while Estonia has an uptake of over 90%, the report said.After leaving his job with the Estonian government in 2024, Luukas Ilves has become an advisor to the Deputy Prime Minister of UkraineImage: 2025 e-Estonia/Trade with EstoniaElectronic identity verification, for example, is a major issue in the report, as 90% of Estonians use national e-IDs to access government services, compared with less than 10% of Germans. The reason for that is simple, Ilves said. The Estonian software is more user-friendly and provides access to both public and private sector services, including retail banking.Ilves told DW that until a few years ago, Belgium had used an e-IDtechnologysimilar to that in Germany. But it performed poorly, with only 10% to 20% of the population using it.But ever since the country's banks and telecommunication operators introduced a user-friendly mobile version that allowed access to both private sector and government services, e-ID uptake has jumped to 80%.Greater acceptance of digital administration services also helps save taxpayers' money, the Ilves report states. The administrative cost of collecting taxes in Estonia, for example, are per capita only one-sixth of those in Germany.Slashing the bureaucratic jungle with OOPFollowing general elections in February, the new German government of Chancellor Friedrich Merz has established aMinistry for Digital Transformation and Government Modernisation (BMDS). Its aim is to offer a \"comprehensive range of services to provide impetus, initiate cooperation and develop solutions for the public administration of the future.\"Digital industry representatives like Magdalena Zadara have welcomed the decision. Zadara is chief of staff and strategy at the German Digital Service, a government agency that develops and implements software to digitalize administrative processes.Zadara thinks the new German ministry can accelerate German digitalizationImage: DigitalService GmbH des BundesSpeaking with DW, she said she was \"optimistic\" about the new digital ministry because it seeks to digitalize services \"end-to-end,\" thereby cutting short the seemingly endless journeys through German bureaucracy.\"If I wanted to come to Germany to work from a country outside the EU, I would have to interact with about five to seven different government agencies to get my diploma approved, and they would maybe even ask for the same data.\"One solution to the problem she has in mind is Estonia's so-called once-only principle (OOP), meaning that citizens and businesses only need to provide information to public authorities once. That data can then be reused and shared internally by all authorities.OOP is one of the pillars of digital government in Estonia and even codified in law.Another hallmark of Estonia's modern administration is the digital signature, which is wi"

At first glance, women's football has never been closer to men's football.Beyond theongoing battle for equal pay, there is however another glaring and striking difference between men's and women's international football in Europe. Most women's teams are significantly whiter than their male counterparts. While fans, players and football institutions strive to make the women's game inclusive, limited access to football in certain communities means Euro 2025 – at least on the pitch – doesn't really reflect many of the nations being represented.Building inclusion – of all kindsAccording to football fan research company Two Circles, European fans of women's football tend to be younger and more female than men's football. An open, comfortable atmosphere in the stands andoutspoken playersis a big part of the draw.\"I think it's a more inclusive environment in women's football. It's much friendlier. It doesn't feel as intimidating,\" Seray, an England fan visiting Switzerland from London, told DW.Many fans want thediversityof the crowds and the inclusive nature of women's football to expand to the social and cultural backgrounds of the women playing the game at the highest level.Just three years ago, hosts and winnersEnglandfaced institutional criticism from prominent former players like Anita Asante and Alex Scott for failing to bring non-white players into the fold. That squad had just three players of Black ancestry, totalling just 13%. Three years on, that number has risen only slightly to 17%, according to Show Racism the Red Card. That is drastically less than the 64% that makes up the England men's squad.Germany, where more than one in four people is either an immigrant or a descendant of an immigrant, had just a handful of players with immigrant roots even beforeSara Doorsounretired from international football andNicole Anyomiwas cut from the Euros roster.Barriers to access mean England's team is significantly less diverse than it could be. They also mean that Germany's tournament squad, like many in the competition, looks little like the country's broader population.\"I'm here, I'm representing England, and I'm British Asian,\" one English fan in Zürich told DW. \"I think diversity is very, very important.\"France's football diversity approach\"My daughter plays football, we're into football,\" a French fan told DW prior to a Euro 2025 match. \"It's important, especially to show every girl who wants to play football, that they feel like they could be part of the French team.\"Franceis leaps and bounds above most European nations, boasting one of the tournament's most diverse squads.The French team is far more diverse than the EnglishImage: Markus Ulmer/Teamfoto/IMAGO\"It's a point of pride to represent your country, regardless of whether it's the men's or women's team. We're all proud to be here and be able to represent France,\" midfielder Grace Geyoro, who was born in theDR Congoand raised in Orleans, France, said at a press conference.French players expressed surprise when asked about the diversity in their squad, as many of them take it as a given and a simple reflection of French culture.\"It's not really something you think about,\" said France attacker Clara Mateo. \"It's true that there's lots of diversity in the various regions of France, and that we're all united on the pitch.\"According to the French FA, France has a dense web of clubs offering girls and women's football throughout the country, meaning an opportunity to play is never far.\"We know football is extremely developed all over France, so this can bring diversity to the team. Above all, it's an asset that we can really use,\" Mateo continued.Breaking down barriers to entryMany football associations are keen to make their football more accessible at the grassroots level, in the hope it will lead to more diversity at the elite level. The English FA, for instance, recently launched a four-year girls and women's football strategy where boosting diversity is a central plank.Euro 2025 hostSwitzerlandhave launched something similar. ZüriKick is a program in Zürich offering free weekly football training to girls at schools, with accessibility to the whole city a major tenant of the project.\"One reason ZüriKick is built into the school program is to ensure easy access.

The megastar also co-produced the film and released an original song for the film's soundtrack in May.Since it was Rihanna's first new track in three years — following rumors that the pop star was retiring from music —  it was big news for her fans.But reactions were mixed: Even though many of them celebrate \"Friend Of Mine\" as \"a club banger,\" others were disappointed to see her return with a song for a kids movie.Rihanna was at the world premiere of 'Smurfs' in Brussels, where comic artist Pierre Culliford, aka Peyo, was bornImage: Omar Havana/AP/picture allianceDominating Hollywood for decades: The Smurfette principleThe Grammy-winning artist-turned-entrepreneur, who's alsopregnantwith her third child, is generally seen as a symbol of Black female empowerment.Yet even though the new \"Smurfs\" movie gives Smurfette an empowering role, the character's name is nevertheless synonymous with an entiresexistpop culturetrope: the Smurfette principle.The concept, which was coined in 1991 byfeministcritic Katha Pollitt in aNew York Timesarticle, refers to a pattern that can still be widely observed in films, TV series or video games: A single female character is surrounded by an otherwise all-male ensemble of heroes.Beyond the Smurfs, the trope can be observed in many other popular universes, from Princess Leia in \"Star Wars\" to Miss Piggy in \"The Muppets,\" from Kanga in \"Winnie the Pooh\" to Peach in \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie.\"The Smurfs are on a mission to the real world to save Papa SmurfImage: Paramount Pictures/LMK/Landmark Media/IMAGOA meta reversal of the Smurfette principle in recent filmsReflectingHollywood's endless cycle of reboots, spin-offs and sequels, the 2025 \"Smurfs\" movie follows three other US-produced features in the franchise, all based on the series first developed in 1958 by Belgian comic artist Peyo.The live-action animated film from 2011, \"The Smurfs,\" reflects on the problematic gender imbalance of the Smurf universe when Gargamel plays with puppets representing the creatures he's obsessed with: \"I'm Papa Smurf,\" he sneers, using a ventriloquist voice as he waves around a blue puppet with a red cap. \"I have 99 sons and one daughter — nothing weird about that!\"Smurfette's original sexist backstory is also revisited in \"The Smurfs 2\" (2013): She was not initially part of the village, but rather created out of clay by Gargamel, who devised her as an evil spy to infiltrate the Smurf community. But once Smurfette gets to know the Smurfs and discover how open and friendly they are, she disowns her master, and Papa Smurf transforms her into a real Smurf.The spell also metamorphoses her into a more stereotypically feminine character: Her unkept black hair is turned into lush blonde locks; her generic Smurf slippers and simple elongated tank top are also magically restyled as high heels and a frilly dress.The Smurfette principle is most directly tackled in \"Smurfs: The Lost Village\" (2017). Smurfette searches for her purpose, seeing that the other Smurfs around her all have a name describing their identity: Brainy, Clumsy or Sleepy. In her self-discovery journey, she lands in a village of all-female Smurfs.Smurfette finds female friends in 'The Lost Village' (2017)Image: Sony Pictures Animation/Capital Pictures/IMAGOA 'gentler form of misogyny'But that attempt to reversegender rolesalso drew criticism: \"I'm all for empowering girls, but not at the detriment of boys. I did not like the way the boy Smurfs were portrayed as bumbling idiots,\" wrote one parent reviewing \"Smurfs: The Lost Village\" on Common Sense Media.Film critic Maryann Johanson saw things similarly. The film \"seems to believe it is feminist, but only doubles down on Smurfily regressive notions of gender,\" she wrote, by \"embracing the gentler form of misogyny that puts women on a pedestal.\"Others pointed out that introducing the new female characters feels more driven by profit than by feminist values by merely expanding options for Smurf merchandisin: \"It's extremely obvious that 'Smurfs: The Lost Village' exists to create a base for a new Smurfs universe that's more or less the same as the old one, except with more girls — and, presumably, more little girls in "

The football star is taking the criticism in stride.https://p.dw.com/p/4xZ1ZNot so long ago nobody would have questioned whether Ada Hegerberg should be in the starting 11Image: Michael Zemanek/Shutterstock/IMAGOAdvertisement\"This isn't just about Ada Hegerberg… It's about what's best forNorway,\" Norwegian broadcaster NRK recently proclaimed, referring to the captain of the women's national football team.The broadcaster added that Hegerberg had \"simply not performed well enough at theEuropean ChampionshipinSwitzerlandto justify a spot in the first eleven. The alternatives are better.\"Most Norwegians seem to agree. In an online survey conducted by NRK with around 20,000 participants, 75% favored not including Hegerberg in the starting lineup for Norway's quarterfinal match against Italy on Wednesday.First Ballon d'Or Féminin winnerAda Hegerberg is one of the biggest stars in women's football. In 2018, she became thefirst winner of the  Ballon d'Or Féminin. Unfortunately, the award ceremony was also remembered for thepresenter asking the football star if she wanted to perform a \"twerk\" on stage.However, Hegerberg's success on the pitch is unquestioned. She is the Champions League's all-time top scorer with 66 goals. Since moving from the then-Bundesliga club Turbine Potsdam to Olympique Lyon in 2014, she has won the Champions League six times, as well as 10 French league titles and six French Cups.Pushing for equal payBut recently, things haven't been going so well for the 30-year-old. She only came on as a substitute in most of her matches for Lyon last season, managing a mere seven goals. That's a far cry indeed from the more than 50 goals that she scored in all competitions in both the 2015-16 and 2017-18 seasons.Hegerberg made her first of 93 appearances for Norway in 2011 at the age of 16,  scoring her 50th goal for in the 2-1 win over hosts Switzerland in the opening match of Euro 2025.Her total appearances and goals could have been significantly higher if Hegerberg hadn't retired from the national team in 2017, partly in protest against the lower bonuses then being paid to female national team players compared to their male counterparts.Hegerberg didn't return until 2022 – following what she described as positive discussions with the then-new Norwegian Football Association president,Lise Klaveness. In 2018, the Norwegian Football Federation (NFF) had also moved to implement equal pay for the women's and men's national teams – something the striker had been demanding.Norway's women have been highly successful over the years, winning the European Championship in 1987 and 1993, the World Cup in 1995 and an Olympic gold medal in 2000. This may be part of the reason that so many girls take up the game in the Scandinavian country.Ada Hegerberg (left) was subbed off in the 75th minute of the opening matchImage: Vegard Grott/Bildbyran/IMAGOAccording to the NFF, around 70,500 female footballers are currently registered with the association, not including girls under 13. This accounts for 27.6% of active players in Norway, while inGermany the equivalent percentageof adult players is 17.2%.Carrying on the fightThe fact that so many girls and women play football in Norway is also something Hegerberg can take credit for. Years after the NFF implemented equal pay, she continues to fight forgreater equality in women's football.\"There are always things that can be improved,\" Hegerberg told Swiss newspaper \"Blick\" before the start of Euro 2025.\"It helps a lot when we perform well. We still have to fight against so many prejudices.\"On the bench on her birthdayBack then, Hegerberg could hardly have imagined that her own performance would  come in for such scrutiny during the tournament. With Norway having already secured a place in the quarterfinals, national team coach Gemma Grainger rested the captain in their final group-stage match against Iceland – on Hegerberg's 30th birthday, of all days.Grainger demonstratively backs Hegerberg. \"She gives her all for this team. I'm very happy with her,\" said the coach. Hegerberg herself remains calm in the face of criticism at home. \"I'm taking it in stride. A little fuss is fine.\"Edited by: Jonathan HardingThis article was originally published in German.Stefan NestlerReporter and editorSpringinsfeldSend us your feedbackYour feedbackAdvertisement"

But she's now disillusioned: antisemitism is on the rise everywhere.https://p.dw.com/p/4xVHxOn July 17, there will be a concert in London in honour of Anita Lasker-WallfischImage: Warner Bros/picture allianceAdvertisementAnita Lasker-Wallfischhas spent an entire century on this earth, and does not fear death. After all, she'd often looked it in the eye when she was deported toAuschwitzsimply for being a Jew. It was the largest and most notorious of the Nazi concentration and extermination camps. There, around around 1.1 million people were killed on an industrial scale.Lasker-Wallfisch survived because she could play the cello.While at Auschwitz, Anita Lasker-Wallfisch spent every day expecting to be killedImage: Frank Schumann/zb/picture allianceFor decades, she has raised her voice againstantisemitism,right-wing extremismandracismas a dedicated witness to history. She has told scores of schoolchildren unsparingly how the Nazis systematically marginalized Jews and ultimately murdered them. She feels it is a duty \"that those who survived must serveas voices for the millions who were silenced.\" That's why she has also taken part in the \"Dimensions in Testimony\" project, in which interactive holograms enableHolocaustsurvivors to answer questions even after their deaths.There was a time when Lasker-Wallfisch was optimistic that her commitment was having an impact. \"I've spoken with thousands of schoolchildren. If just 10 of them would behave properly, I'd be satisfied,\" she said.Recordings for the contemporary witness programmeImage: obs/Stiftung EVT/USC Shoa Foundation/Z. LightfootNever heard of the Holocaust?But in the meantime, Lasker-Wallfisch has become overwhelmed by hopelessness. \"She's in despair,\" her daughter, Maya, told the weekly newspaperJüdische Allgemeine Zeitung. Growing antisemitism, an increasing shift towards the extreme right and thesituation in the Middle Eastall give Maya's mother the impression that all her commitment hasn't amounted to much.Considering the current global situation, her despondency is understandable. It's not only because 12% of Germans aged 18 to 29 have never heard of the Holocaust, according to a recent Jewish Claims Conference survey. It's also because since Israel's war in Gaza, antisemitism has been spreading worldwide.\"Is it important whether you'reJewish? You're simply a human being,\" she recently told German dailySüddeutsche Zeitung.'I didn't know I was Jewish'Born Anita Lasker on July 17, 1925 in Breslau, she was the youngest of three sisters in a middle-class family. Her father was a lawyer and her mother a violinist. Her parents valued a good education and music was part of that. The Laskers were not at all religious.\"I didn't know I was Jewish until they spat at me and called me a ‘dirty Jew',\" she said decades later. \"We were ordinary, fully assimilated Germans.\" That was in 1933, the year the Nazis seized power. Her parents had no illusions about what the Nazi regime planned to do with the Jews. At the end of 1939, they brought Anita's eldest sister, Marianne, to safety in England. But they were unable to save themselves. After they were deported in 1942, she never saw her mother or father again.Anita and her sister Renate Lasker-Harpprecht (left, † 2021) received the Jewish Museum Berlin Prize for Understanding and Tolerance in 2016Image: picture-alliance/Eventpress HHHLasker-Wallfisch and her sister, Renate, had to work as forced laborers at a paper factory. She used this opportunity to forge documents for other forced laborers from France, enabling them to return to their homeland. In 1943, when the two sisters tried to flee with forged passports, they were imprisoned. Five months later, they arrived separately at Auschwitz.The 'Cellist of Auschwitz'Because Lasker-Wallfisch could play an instrument, she was assigned to the girls' orchestra at Auschwitz. \"The cello saved my life,\" she later said. When the forced laborers left the camp in the morning and returned in the evening, the orchestra played music for them to march to. On Sundays, the girls performed for the SS.Music under the swastikaTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 video\"Not a single one of us believed we'd make it out of Auschwitz in any other way than up the chimney,\" were her words. In 1944, when Soviet troops were advancing on Auschwitz, Lasker-Wallfisch and her sister were moved to the extremely overcrowded concentration camp at Bergen-Belsen, where people died of hunger, thirst and disease. \"Auschwitz was a camp that systematically murdered people,\" she later wrote in her memoirs, \"in Belsen, you just died.\"'We're full of hope and new courage'British soldiers liberated the camp on April 15, 1945.

That was the only thing, for the rest, it was a similar preparation as the last four years,\" explained Kristof de Kegel,sports scientistand Head of Performance at racing team Alpecin Deceuninck.Mathieu van der Poel, who has already worn yellow several times on this Tour, and therecently injured Jasper Philipsenare part of that team, but the question is: Have the riders noticed the impact of heat training?\"The team in general is strong. So that's what we think. There is no 100% link, but if we see how the team performs now and we see what we did differently from the past years, then I would say that,\" de Kegel told DW.Targeted fever for better performanceThe coaches of multipleTour de Francewinner Tadej Pogacar also swear by the extra kick provided by heat stimulation.\"We supplement the altitude training with heat training,\" Jeroen Swart, sports scientist at UAE Emirates XRG, told DW. The aim is to raise the body's core temperature to 38.5 degrees Celcius (101,3 degrees Fahrenheit), a slightly feverish state.Heat training can be done passively,Austrianprofessional cyclist Felix Gall told DW.\"Then you go to the sauna or take a warm bath after training.  With active heat training, you put on a lot of clothes during the last climb in altitude training camp or get the exercise bike.\"Legendary rider Eddy Merckx was exhausted when he reached the finish line of stage 14 in 1979. He needed oxygen support, but remarkably went on to win the Tour.Image: UPI/dpa/picture allianceScientific foundationsCarsten Lundby, a sports scientist from the University of Odense,Denmark, has been researching the effects of heat and altitude training and the combination of both for around 10 years.\"Heat training, in my opinion, is more effective than altitude training, when it's done as most cycling teams do it today,\" Lundby told DW.This is mainly due to the fact that more people react to the stimuli that heat triggers in the human body than to the stress caused by thin air at altitude.\"The effects of heat training are more potent and much more widespread than altitude training,\" said Lundby. \"Some people don't respond to altitude training at all. On the other hand, it's very rare for someone not to respond to heat training. Heat is a much bigger stressor than altitude. If I had to choose between the two forms, I would always choose heat training,\" Lundby said.His studies have shown, among other things, that heat training not only increases blood volume. The greater amount of fluid can ensure that the red blood cells are better distributed in the muscle tissue, allowing more oxygen to reach them and increasing performance. The stress factor of heat also stimulates the formation of new red blood cells, which is exactly what you would expect from altitude training.Deliberately putting the body in this stressful situation carries certain risks for health, especially for the cardiovascular system and the mind. For professional racers, who are constantly accompanied and monitored by doctors, health problems such asdehydration, loss of minerals, breathing difficulties, heatstroke, sunstroke and a sudden drop in performance are usually easy to control and can be avoided in advance.Early adapters 33 years agoOf course, none of this is entirely new, at least not for German champion Georg Zimmermann, who is also competing in the 2025 Tour de France.\"I've been a big sauna fan for years,\" said Zimmermann. \"It's almost a hobby of mine. That's why I've been doing it since before the topic even came up, without knowing it was training.\"Rolf Aldag, former pro cyclist and sports director at the Red Bull-Bora-hansgrohe team knows those who were early adapters.\"At the 1992 World Championships in Benidorm, Miguel Indurain arrived wearing a thermal jacket and leg warmers. That was 33 years ago.\"Back then, this was considered original. Nowadays, however, the performance managers of cycling teams integrate heat training into their routines. Heat training is also trending in other sports.Formula 1 racing teams Ferrariand Red Bull had their drivers train specifically for the heat before the 2022 Grand Prix in Singapore, and heat training is also becoming increasingly popular with marathon runners.In cycling, hea"

But a lack of power transmission lines is proving a massive bottleneck.https://p.dw.com/p/4xVaUThe German power lines are struggling to keep pace with the growth in renewable energyImage: Goldmann/dpa/picture allianceAdvertisementGermany's so-called new high-voltage electricity highways are growing, but experts say their development is failing to keep up with the country's rapid growth inrenewable energy.As the wind-rich north of Germany produces ever-increasing volumes of renewable energy in onshore and offshorewind parks, the country's southern regions, where most industrial companies are situated, are craving for electricity, still heavily relying on gas or coal-fired power plants and a bit ofsolar energy.Almost two decades ago, four transmission system operators (TSOs) were tasked by the German government with building new power lines from north to south.Being responsible for Germany's high-voltage grid, TSOs maintain, operate, plan and expand grid infrastructure.For example, 50Hertz Transmission — owned by Belgian company Elia Group (80%) and German state-owned KfW banking group (20%) — controls the grid in eastern Germany and parts of it in the north.  German TSO Amprion is responsible for an 11,000 kilometer (6,800 mile) grid that spans from northern Germany to the Alps in the south. Then, there is TransnetBW in southwestern Germany, and Dutch state-owned TenneT — Europe's biggest TSO.Germany's regulator,the Federal Network Agency, has defined five steps these companies must follow before construction can begin.It starts with the development of a \"scenario framework\" in which the TSOs outline the likely evolution of energy supply and demand. Next, they must prepare a \"grid development plan\" and submit an \"environmental report.\" In the third step, a \"federal requirement plan\" is created, followed by a \"spatial planning procedure\" in the fourth. The final step is the official \"planning approval process.\"Even after that, construction doesn't immediately begin. The Federal Network Agency — or a relevant regional authority — must still carry out a final \"environmental impact assessment.\"Progress on grid expansion hampered by setbacksGermany's Power Grid Expansion Act, known as EnLAG, came into force in 2009, and is intended to accelerate the expansion of the power grid to support thetransition to renewable energy sources.According to the Federal Network Agency, the regulation calls for around 128 construction projects totaling 16,832 kilometers of power lines by the end of 2024. However, a total of only 34 projects have been \"fully completed\" until now, the agency said in a statement to DW.What's even more astonishing is that the German regulator expects construction to continue for another eight to 20 years — unless new projects are added.In order to speed up the expansion, the agency's president, Klaus Müller, told German business dailyHandelsblattin May that the system \"by which grid fees are collected\" would need to be reformed.Due to public pressure, some regional German governments want to see cables laid underground which is costly and time-consumingImage: Carsten Rehder/dpa/picture allianceThe charges for using the electricity grid, paid solely by consumers, have been steadily risingin recent years, and now make up about a quarter of electricity bills, varying by region. Müller suggested that grid fees in the future should also be paid by power plant operators and renewable energy providers.Although public resistance to grid expansion has been relatively low-key and so far limited to local pressure groups, the government fears that further rising electricity bills may erode support, leading to more protests and delays in the courts.Could the expansion go faster?Setting a firm timeline for when the expansion of Germany's high-voltage grid will be complete isn't realistic.TenneT spokesperson Maria Köhler thinks grid expansion is \"not a task that will be completed at a specific point in time.\" She told DW that it was \"an ongoing process\" toward a climate-neutral network, with a \"target year of 2037 and an extended outlook through 2045.\"Why Germany's grid rejects the gift of summerTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 videoSome grid operators, however, are planning to move faster.50Hertz Transmission, for example, hasmore ambitious goals, according to company spokesperson Karin Dietl.\"In our grid area, we want to fully integrate 100% renewable energy into the grid and system by 2032,\" she said in an email statement to DW.Dietl also pointed to the impediments that would hinder a more rapid expansion pace, such as \"a shortage of skilled labor, supply bottlenecks, and lengthy approval processes.\"TenneT cit"

Jisoo, Jennie, Rosé and Lisa take on alternating roles asfashionicons, brand ambassadors and influencers, too.Their \"Deadline World Tour,\" which is whisking them across the globe on the big stage, kicked off on July 5.Six days later, they also released a single, \"Jump,\" their first new track in three years.The new banger reminds some music fans of the 1997 Berlin Love Parade track, \"Meet Her at the Love Parade,\" by German DJ Da Hool.\"Girlfriend sends me the Blackpink song, I send girlfriend Da Hool back. Glad I'm not the only one who thought of this song, brain instantly flashed back to the 90s,\" wrote one user under the official video of the 1997 track.Product of the South Korean entertainment industryBlackpink was founded by YG Entertainment — one of the biggest companies in the K-pop industry. As is common in South Korea, the young women underwent years of training in singing, dance, languages and stage presence.Their debut, a double single featuring the songs \"Boombayah\" and \"Whistle,\" came out in 2016. The combination of electronic beats, spoken singing, catchy refrains and lyrics in Korean and English was a sensational hit — even outside of Asia.Blackpink at the 2022 MTV Video Music AwardsImage: AdMedia/Starface/IMAGOSymbol of the 'Korean wave'With their music, elaborate music videos and a very distinct style concept, Blackpink quickly rose to become one of the most successful K-pop groups of all time. Their breakthrough epitomizes the \"Korean wave\" (in Korean hallyu) — the international rise in South Korean culture since the 2000s.Despite Blackpink's success and the impending comeback of the boy group BTS, this music genre hasn't been booming as much in recent years, according to Adam Zulawnik, a researcher and teaching specialist in Korean Studies at the University of Melbourne. But he adds that the South Korean entertainment industry is extremely resilient and innovative — not least thanks to special support from the government. The aim is not only to boost the economy, but especially to pursue thenational strategy for so-called soft power: This sector is meant to help reinforce South Korea's positive image through cultural exports such as K-pop or Korean Netflix series.Four personalities — one styleUnlike many other K-pop groups, Blackpink features just four members — and each one has their own special vibe.Jennie, who grew up in New Zealand, is known for her fashion style and her role as a brand ambassador for Chanel.Jisoo is the group's visual icon and is also a successful actress.Rosé was born in New Zealand, grew up in Australia, and enthralls audiences with her soulful voice and melancholic style.Lisa, originally from Thailand, enthuses audiences with her precise dancing skills and international social media presence.This diversity has enabled the group to appeal to a broad variety of target groups worldwide — both through their music and visually.\"Many South Korean artists have, indeed, either transcended or perhaps even discarded a certain 'Korean'ness' in favor of a more general artistic style,\" Adam Zulawnik told DW. \"A prime example would be Blackpink's Rosé and Bruno Mars' fairly recent hit single 'APT,' a tune that you would hardly associate with traditional forms of K-pop or anything Korean save the title/theme and Bruno Mars enthusiastically waving a South Korean flag mid shot — in fact, many netizens saw the more general 'pop/rock' style as refreshing.\"Blackpink trademarks: Fashion and beautyBlackpink is famous for more than their music — they're also big-name fashion and beauty influencers. All four members collaborate with international luxury brands, including Dior, Chanel, Saint Laurent or Celine, alongside cosmetic brands like MAC or Hera. Fans imitate their looks all over the world.The overlap between pop culture and the fashion industry stems from the South Korean entertainment industry's comprehensive marketing strategy. Zulawnik lists some examples, \"from BTS meals at McDonald's in Australia to 17 branded snacks in the People's Republic of China.\"He adds that this is particularly visible in Southeast Asia — one of the primary markets for the K-pop industry — with various collaborative projects between K-pop groups "

Early on she developed an interest in performance art, including experiments with sound installations.In 1973, the young artist was invited to Edinburgh, Scotland, for an international art festival, where she debuted her first provocative performance work.Titled \"Rhythm 10,\" Abramovic thrust 10 sharp knives between her splayed fingers — a daredevil act in which she occasionally missed and drew blood. In Edinburgh, where the young artist and occasional painter met iconic German performance artistJoseph Beuys, she also realized she had found her medium.\"I had experienced absolute freedom — I had felt that my body was without boundaries, limitless; that pain didn't matter, that nothing mattered at all — and it all intoxicated me,\" recalled Abramovic of that first performance in her 2016 autobiography, \"Walk Through Walls.\"\"I was drunk from the overwhelming energy that I'd received. That was the moment I knew that I had found my medium. No painting, no object that I could make, could ever give me that kind of feeling, and it was a feeling I knew I would have to seek out, again and again and again.\"Testing the limitsAbramovic has since carved a reputation as a pioneeringperformance artistwho continues to test her physical and psychological limits.Arguably her most provocative early work was 1974's \"Rhythm 0,\" a performance in Italy, this time in Naples. In it, Abramovic directed the audience: \"There are 72 objects on the table that one can use on me as desired.\"The objects included razor blades, knives and a loaded gun. The artist sat motionless as people cut open her clothes or slashed her skin. One person aimed the loaded gun at her head. \"If you leave it up to the audience, they can kill you,\" Abramovic said after the performance in which she sought to expose an inherent human cruelty.Earlier that year, her performance \"Rhythm 5\" included a burning communist star. She laid herself in the middle of it after cutting and burning her hair and nails. When the fire had consumed all the oxygen, Abramovic passed out.This career path was soon taken in tandem with German artistFrank \"Ulay\" Uwe Laysiepen, who in 1976 became Abramovic's lover and collaborator for 12 years.The 1977 performance\"Imponderabilia\" was typical of their oeuvre; Abramovic and Ulay stood at the entrance of a Bologna museum naked, forcing visitors to squeeze past them to enter.This work is now reperformed by other artists at the Royal Academy. Here too, visitors must squeeze between two nude models to enter the show. There is, however, a separate entrance for those who are uncomfortable with participating in the unusual performance.Marina Abramovic and Ulay perform 'Relation in Space' in Venice in 1976Image: Ulay/Marina AbramovićMarina Abramovic and Ulay lived as free spirits in their small Citroen bus for four years, traveling through Europe and performing.Even their separation in 1988 was sealed with an elaborate performance. In a piece titled \"The Lovers,\" they walked towards each other along the Great Wall of China, starting at opposite ends and meeting in the middle. After covering some 4,000 kilometers (2485 miles), they said goodbye.Balkan BaroqueThe separation inspired the artist to break new ground.In 1997, she performed a work in the international section of the Venice Biennale titled \"Balkan Baroque,\" a comment on the Yugoslav Wars, in which she spent seven hours a day washing a mountain of bloody cow bones. Her performance was awarded a Golden Lion.Marina Abramovic laid bare the horrors of the Yugoslav Wars in 'Balkan Baroque'Image: Marina Abramović , Courtesy of the Marina Abramović Archives VG Bild-Kunst, Bonn 2018Since the 1990s, she has also been teaching her \"Abramovic Method\" to young performance artists.

But the country will have to overcome hurdles — and shouldn't go it alone, experts warn.French PresidentEmmanuel Macronwas already making the case for what he called \"strategic autonomy\" back in 2017.\"When it comes to defense, our aim should be for Europe to have the capacity to act autonomously, alongsideNATO,\" he said during a speech at Sorbonne University in Paris.At the time, his appeal fell on deaf ears in the European Union, especially on those of then German ChancellorAngela Merkel.Waking up amid new global realitiesEight years on, the mindset has changed.Russia has been invading Ukrainefor three years now. More recently,Donald Trumpwas elected for a second term as US president. He's adamant his country should no longer be theguarantor of Europe's security.EU responds to Trump with massive rearmament driveTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 videoThe EU has reacted to the new geopolitical reality by announcing it wants tospend €800 billion ($882 billion) on defenseuntil 2030 under a program calledReArm Europe.Several EU countries are planning to increase their national defense spending — including Spain, Italy and France.French President Macron has announced that an additional €6.5 billion ($7.6 billion) will be invested in defense in 2026 and 2027, taking the country's defense budget to €64 billion by the end of his term in 2027. That would mean the defense budget will have doubled between 2017, when Macron was first elected, and 2027.Fanny Coulomb, a lecturer at French university Sciences Po in Grenoble, says the country's 4,500 defense companies employing about 200,000 people are the backbone of the continent's defense sector.\"France has players in all segments of the sector. We've upheld these skills since the 1960s as opposed to some other countries,\" Coulomb, who specializes in defense economics, told DW.\"We reduced our expenses after the end of the Cold War in the 1990s, but the terror attacks on the World Trade Center in New York and the subsequent war on terror reversed that trend,\" she explained.French soldiers still know how to fight a war after missions in Libya and the Sahel region, says CoulombImage: Aurelie Bazzara-Kibangula/AFP/Getty ImagesFrance still has 'war culture'Sylvie Matelly, another defense expert, thinks that all of this has contributed to maintaining a certain \"war culture\" in French society.\"We need to be able to understand the nature of the threat in order to know which weapons are required,\" the director of Paris-based think tank Institut Jacques Delors told DW. \"Paris has kept up that capacity for military analysis unlike countries such as Germany.\"She also said that France has become a forerunner regarding so-called Systems-of-Systems (SoS) capability, which is a set of unique systems that perform a common mission by combining the synergistic effect of multiple systems,\" according to aglossarycompiled by the US Defense Acquisition University (DAU) in Fort Belvoir, Virginia.Matelly says this includes, for example, high-tech products like the French Rafale fighter jets or the Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier.\"Meanwhile, we have drastically reduced our production of light weapons and ammunitions. We thought it'd be easy to kickstart it again, as these products are less complex,\" she added.France's fleet of military aircraft carriers like the Charles de Gaulle are capabilities no other country in the EU hasImage: Marine Nationale/abaca/picture allianceBut there are hurdles to restart, or boost, military production.\"We'll need large amounts of raw materials which are difficult to source, especially since our sanctions on the important minerals supplier Russia after its invasion of Ukraine,\" Coulomb said. \"What's more, we have to urgently train more engineers and specialists, as our industrial sectors have constantly been declining over the past few decades.\"And money might be an issue.

At the time, the district council of Berlin-Mitte had approved the renaming, but, before it was implemented, residents filed a lawsuit against it.The Higher Administrative Court of Berlin-Brandenburg has now upheld a decision by the Berlin Administrative Court stating that residents have no basis to take legal action against the name change.Several civil society groups have lobbied for decades to change the name of Mohren or \"Moor\" Street (respectfully referred to as M-Strasse), and the U-Bahn station of the same name.Moor, in its Greek roots, means dark or black, but also \"stupid or primitive,\" Aikins said.Dividing up Africa from BerlinM-Strasse runs through the old quarter of the former Prussian city, steps away from the rebuiltBerlin Palace, which oversawcolonialforays into Africa, and near the former chancellor's residence and venue for the 1884Berlin Conference.In the words of Berlin-based British-Ugandan writer Musa Okwonga, the major European colonial powers that gathered for the conference \"discussed how they mightdivide up Africa.\" The conference kick-startedGermany's genocidal colonial ruleinNamibia.How the Berlin Conference spurred the colonization of AfricaTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 videoThe M-word's overt racist connotations further derive from the 18th-century practice of bringing enslaved Africans to Germany as \"court moors\" to work as servants or entertain the Brandenburg electors and Prussian kings as musicians. \"The street name given at the beginning of the 18th century transports this racist experience of violence against Black people in Berlin to the present day,\" wrote historian Christian Kopp, of Decolonize Berlin-Mitte.These slaves were mostly brought from the Brandenburg-Prussian colony in current-day Ghana (then known as the Brandenburger Gold Coast), which existed from 1682 to 1721.Anton Wilhelm Amo himself is believed to have been enslaved in Ghana as a boy, and was ultimately gifted to the Duke of Braunschweig-Wolfenbüttel in 1707, the year M-Strasse was named. Despite his displacement, he embraced his German identity while never forgetting his African heritage.Amo's thesis in law at the University of Halle is lost but was titled \"The Rights of Blacks in Europe.\" He learned six languages and later wrote a doctoral thesis that weighed in on Rene Descartes' mind-body duality. Yet this Black German trailblazer has been largely erased from European intellectual history.For over a decade, decolonial activists have simply added an umlaut to the 'o' of M-Strasse to make it Möhren, or Carrots StreetImage: Imago/Bernd FriedelThe long journey to Anton-Wilhelm-Amo-StrasseThe M-Strasse subway station was itself the product of a renaming in 1991, in the wake of reunification, having been previously called Otto-Grotewohl-Strasse after a GDR politician.The use of the racist name was called out at the time by the pioneering Black German activist May Ayim, a poet of Ghanaian descent who co-founded the Initiative of Black People in Germany in 1986 and edited the defining book \"Showing Our Colors: Afro-German Women Speak Out.\"Ayim (right) with the American poet and activist Audre Lorde.. They worked together to build a Black German identity in Berlin in the 1980s and early '90sImage: Dagmar SchultzAyim pursued her efforts to reveal the coded racism in reunified Germany. In the 1990s, she was outspoken in her opposition to the street name, which in her view stood for the fact that Germany's Black community was not included in the country's essentially white reunification process after the fall of the Berlin Wall.In 2010, a Kreuzberg riverfront was renamed after Ayim, who died in 1996. It was one of the first acts of decolonization, the shore having been named after Otto Friedrich von der Groeben, who in the late 17th century founded the Brandenburg-Prussian colony in Ghana.This is an updated and shortened version of anarticlethat was first published on August 28, 2020.Stuart BraunBerlin-based journalist with a focus on climate and culture.Send us yo"

The star players are impressing fans, but the familiar problems remain.https://p.dw.com/p/4x4qxZambia's Barbra Banda is one of the game's biggest starsImage: Justina Aniefiok/Shengolpixs/IMAGOAdvertisementThe rescheduled women's Africa Cup of Nations (WAFCON) is underway in Morocco, a year later than planned. The tournament sees some of the best players in the world fighting for glory, but as players and nations emerge, familiar problems linger that threaten to prevent the tournament from reaching its full potential.While not a traditional powerhouse,Moroccois becoming the emerging epicenter of women's football on the continent. Thanks to no competing bids and some of the best stadiums in Africa, Morocco has become a stable and safe choice for the Confederation of African Football (CAF) to host the tournament. They are hosting again this time around, after having hosted in 2022. They are also set to host in 2026.Recent investment in the women's game in Morocco is clearly paying off. The women's team unexpectedly reached the World Cup knockout stages in 2023 and have developed star players such as captain and legend Ghizlane Chebbak, who scored a hat trickagainst DR Congo in the group stage of this year's WAFCON. UnderJorge Vilda, who was sacked as Spain's coach after the 2023 scandal involvingformer Spanish Federation President Luis Rubiales, Morocco are daring to challenge the established football forces ofNigeriaandSouth Africa. They also have the potential to deliver lasting cultural change to both northern Africa and the rest of the continent.Elsewhere at WAFCON, Nigerian superstar Asisat Oshoala,Zambia'sstriking duo ofBarbra Bandaand Racheal Kundananji andSouth Africahead coach Desiree Ellis are just some of the star-studded names that make this year's tournament one of the most intriguing ever.A star of Asisat Oshoala's caliber deserves to play in front of bigger crowdsImage: Justina Aniefiok/Shengolpixs/IMAGOFamiliar problems in playThe tournament is held back from reaching its full potential by off-field decisions. As a result of the delay, scheduling for the tournament only came out at the end of May, leaving promotion somewhat last minute, especiallycompared to the Euros. Furthermore, with three stadiums in Morocco being renovated for the men's tournament, three smaller grounds are now being used, affecting attendance numbers.\"We don't celebrate this team enough,\" Ellis said of her players ahead of their opening game. \"That needs to change because many of them are not full-time professionals; that's what makes it the hardest part.\"Beyond the elusive recognition that many of these teams deserve is the question of fair financial compensation. South Africa's tournament build-up has been hampered by financial issues, with reports that players were not training and sponsors hadn't been secured. An agreement with the players has since been reached, but the team's frustration is one that sadly many other nations competing this summer will likely be able to relate to.\"Women in sports, in general, are getting the leftovers,\" Ellis said.Women's football on the rise in AfricaTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 videoPay gap still wideThe prize money on offer is also a contentious issue.On the face of it, the CAF announcement that the prize fund for this year's WAFCON had been increased by 45% was positive, with the winners now receiving €853,000 ($1 million). But that total is not only less than the winners of the other two women's competitions this summer — the Euros (€1.75 million) and Copa America Femenina (€1.3 million). It is worth noting that the Euros total prize money is up by 156% from the last edition. As is often the case for most women's tournaments, the pot is considerably smaller than the men's version. While €853,000 for this year's WAFCON winners is obviously a step in the right direction, it is still a long way off the €6 millionSenegal'smen got for winning the AFCON in 2023.This pay gap marks a wider issue in the women's game, which many players at this year's WAFCON have to contend with. As FIFA's annual report on women's football in March this year revealed, sustainable income remains elusive for many in the professional game. In the report, FIFA highlighted that the global average annual salary for a woman playing professional football is €9,952 ($10,900). Players at teams given the Tier 1 designation were on an average salary of €20,492 but the average of those at Tier 2 and 3 clubs was €3,719 and €2,392 respectively. While many of the 288 players at this year's WAFCON play their club football in Europe, only a handful play at top outfits. For example, only 10 play in the NWSL (top women's league in the USA) or the WSL (top women's "

At times, it has appeared to buckle under the strain ofsanctions— at others, it has shown unexpected strength.In 2023, Russia's gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 4.1%, and in 2024, by 4.3%.However, the momentum, largely fueled by the shift to a wartime economy, now appears to be dwindling. Many economists expect Russia's growth to be cut in half, dropping to just 2%.Even the Russian central bank is expecting a slowdown, Russian state news agency Interfax reported recently, sticking to its lower forecast of between 1% and 2% growth for 2025, and 0.5% to 1.5% next year.The German Munich-based ifo Institute is even more pessimistic, predicting that after a modest uptick in 2025, Russia's economy will contract by 0.8% in 2026.One major drag is Russia's exorbitantly high interest rate, currently 21%, which is choking off private investment.

Trump had hinted at closer cooperation and even a loosening or repeal of US sanctions, which triggered \"euphoria\" on Russian financial markets, with stocks and the ruble both \"appreciating significantly,\" Astrov said.Will euphoria vanish on tighter sanctions?In November 2024, the US toughened sanctions on Gazprombank, a major Russian bank belonging tothe state-owned energy giant, excluding it from the US financial system. The move froze its US assets and cut off business with American firms. Gazprombank is central to processing gas payments and financing military-related projects.While the European Union had exempted Gazprombank from sanctions until the end of 2024 to allow continued payments for Russian gas, the US move had an immediate impact. The ruble lost a quarter of its value against the dollar, and the stock market plunged, especially in the financial and energy sectors.After US credit card companies left Russia, Moscow set up a nationwide credit card payment system called MIRImage: Alexander Ryumin/TASS/dpa/picture allianceIt was no surprise, then, that Russian policymakers paid close attention when Donald Trump, after a late-April meeting with Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyyin Rome, hinted it might be time to \"deal with [Putin] differently.\"US Senate prepares new sanctions legislationTrump's threat of secondary sanctions refers to penalties imposed on third countries, companies, or individuals thatcontinue doing business with Russia.Trump ally Senator Lindsey Graham and a bipartisan group of US senators, meanwhile, have prepared legislation to expand sanctions to any country imp"

Children frompoorer socioeconomic backgrounds have been particularly affected.Research suggests thatchildren's cognitive skills are declining— reflected in kids having weaker memories, attention spans, and diminished flexible thinking skills.So, some experts are suggesting that specialized 'brain training' programs be used in schools toimprove those skills.Cognitive scientists are interested in testing whether these will help train children's working memory, with brain training programs that present kids with puzzles and other challenges.The working memory is themind's staging area, where information is processed in the short term. It's the bit that you use when you're struggling through a math or logic problem — the part of our mind that can feel blocked when you can't find a solution.\"The challenge is that some children's working memories are limited, and it's a huge bottleneck for learning,\" said Thomas Perry, a social scientist and education researcher at the University of Warwick, UK.Brain training programs claim to boost these brain skills.German study shows brain training boosts children's attainmentOne recent study claimed to show that a12-hour working memory training programhad improved children's focus, IQ and long-term academic outcomes.The study followed 572Germanschoolchildren aged 6–7 years over three years. One group of children completed a 12-hour-long working memory training over a period of 5 weeks. The kids who did the training missed out on an equivalent time of mathematics or German classes. Meanwhile, a control group of children had regular classes.They found that children who completed the training had increases in working memory capacity up to a year after the training.Three years after the program, researchers found that the trained children had 16% higher chances of entering an academic track at secondary school — 46% instead of the average 30%.\"I was surprised by the breadth of benefits, not just for working memory and closely related academic subjects. Even broader capacities such as IQ and self-control improved,\" said Torkel Klingberg, a neuroscientist at Karolinska Institute, Sweden, who designed the intervention but was not involved in the study.How does our memory work — In Good ShapeTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 videoAre brain training apps worth it?The children in the study trained working memory through a series of different cognitive tasks, including visuospatial tests to see whether they would remember where things were on a screen.They used a publicly available app calledNuroe, which the study authors claim can help strengthen children's core learning system in thebrain.Perry, who was not involved in the research, said the study correctly measured how working memory training mediated academic performance.However, he said, \"We can't make grand claims based on one study. We need to verify the results with large scale efficacy trials in different schools and with different teachers.\"Already, however, he said there were indications that teachers who thought boosting IQ and critical thinking were important were teaching less substantive information related to the curriculum.\"This is damaging for some kids. For example, disadvantaged kids oftenaren't immersed in reading at home, so they really need dedicated time at school for learning to read.

But when they are tested in classrooms, they tend to show limited results.\"There's a picture emerging from the research is that some studies show working memory training is potentially effective in certain settings, but other studies show no effect at all,\" Perry said.\"We don't have this critical body of studies to say that working memory training is a good thi"

But how can a fossil fuel that emits many planet-heating greenhouse gases be clean?https://p.dw.com/p/4xCXMAs the LNG export business booms, are attempts to label the fossil gas as green energy credible?Image: Stefan Sauer/dpa/picture allianceAdvertisementThe Gulf Coast state of Louisiana, home to the largest liquified natural gas (LNG) export facility in the US, has recently rebranded the fossil fuel as \"green\" energy.It is the fourth Republican majority state after Indiana, Ohio and Tennessee to have taken this step and comes as US President Donald Trumprolls back renewable energysubsidies and incentives in favor ofoil and gas.The US is the world'sbiggest exporter of LNG, much of which has been shipped to Europe since 2022, whenRussian gas supplywas slashed following theinvasion of Ukraine.A gas flare at a Cameron Parish LNG facility in Louisiana, one of numerous plants where gas is liquified for exportImage: John AllaireThat hasn't stopped theEuropean Unionfrom also classifying natural gas-powered electricity, now sourced largely from importedLNG, as green energy in some contexts. The reasoning is that it is a more sustainable way to transition to renewables like solar and wind since it has a lower carbon footprint than coal.But critics point to a leaky and energy-intensive supply chain that releases a lot of planet-heating methane into the atmosphere.What is LNG, and can it be clean?Though it also contains small amounts of ethane, propane, butane and nitrogen, Liquid Natural Gas is more than 90% methane.Methane accumulates in the atmosphere for only around 12 years, as opposed to CO2 that persists for centuries, but it has an outsized impact on the climate.Germany starts building its own LNG terminalTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 videoFor one thing, the greenhouse gas is around 85 times more powerful than CO2 at trapping heat over a 20-year period.Scientists estimate that while methane only accounts for 3% of greenhouse gas emissions since 1750 — the beginning of industrialization — it is responsible for 25-30% of the subsequent global warming.One 2024 study concludes that LNG has a 33% larger greenhouse gas footprint than coal over 20 years, due in part to methane leakages in the supply chain and energy-intensive processing and shipping.\"Natural gas and shale gas are all bad for the climate. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is worse,\" said Robert Howarth, lead author of the study and professor of ecology and environmental biology at Cornell University.Where does LNG come from?In the United States, LNG is made up of gas that is mined from underground shale using a method called hydraulic fracturing, orfracking. This in itself is a controversial process, which critics say pollutes water supplies and air, as well as devastating habitat and biodiversity.Once it has been pulled from underground, the gas is piped to coastal processing plants and supercooled to around -161 degrees Celsius (-258 degrees Fahrenheit) to create a clear, colorless liquid.This liquified gas is much more compact, having been reduced to around 1/600th of its original volume. As such, it can be stored and transported long distances on \"cryogenic\" LNG tankers that keep the gas very cold, including to locations not accessible by pipelines.When the LNG arrives at purpose-built terminals, it is regasified and piped into the existing gas network.So while European countries once received most of their gas directly from Russia via land and sea pipelines, many have been building LNG terminals to ship gas primarily from the US, but also Qatar and Algeria.Imports from the US dropped by 19% in 2024 from the highs of the previous year. However, Russian supplies entring the bloc in 2024 went up by 18%. That is despite a commitment tophase-out imports from the countryby 2027.LNG's role in a clean energy futureNatural gas has long been touted as a \"bridge\" fuel to a fossil-free energy system because it has around half the carbon emissions of coal.This premise has helped governments claim that LNG is a relatively clean energy source.But beyond the potent methane emissions associated with shale gas fracking in the US — the source of most LNG in the country — supercooling, shipping and regasification require a lot of emission-intensive energy.Designating LNG as a green component of a climate-neutral energy future will be difficult as coal plants close and methane becomes the biggest greenhouse gas polluter.Burning LNG, like other fossil fuels, releases emissions that have warmed the planet and made extreme weather events more common and more intenseImage: Eric Vryn/Getty ImagesMethane is likely responsible for as much as 50% of temperature rise in the last decade, said Howarth at a Climate Change Conference in Bonn, Germany in "

The US president hailed the \"tremendous\" agreement by the military alliance's 32 membersto ramp up defense spending to 5% of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2035.Trump had pressured fellow NATO members to do so for years. However, he reserved his customary ire for one member: Spain.After vocal opposition from the country's prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, Spain's government found a way out of the 5% commitment by claiming that it could meet itsdefense obligationsby spending much less.NATO leaders agree to raise defense spendingTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 videoTrump said the decision was \"very terrible\" and Spain would be made to \"pay twice as much.\"Sanchez said the 5% target —which breaks down to 3.5% on defense and 1.5% on related infrastructure— was unreasonable and diverting public spending in such a way could damage the economy.In the end, Spain secured an agreement with NATO that granted it an effective opt-out. That has raised questions about the extent to which many member nations will ultimately be able to afford the spending pledges they have made.Tightened budgets\"The choice to ring-fence and prioritize defense amidst public spending cuts is politically challenging and will need strong public messaging to be accepted by the electorate and indeed across governments in office,\" Fenella McGerty, senior fellow for defense economics at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), told DW.When Spain's government had signaled a hike in defense spending in April, McGerty said, Sanchez was keen to emphasize that the increase would not add to the country's debt or affect social spending.Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez (left) balked at the 5% hikeImage: Jesús Hellín/EUROPA PRESS/dpaIlke Toygür, director of the global policy center at Madrid's IE University, told DW that Spain's position is partly about having an \"open conversation\" on the fact that prioritizing defense spending would affect other key areas of national budgets and could lead to a damaging backlash.\"If there is no understanding about the importance of the fight against climate change or on other social issues, for example, housing or support for health or education, then this [defense spending hike] will create the contrary effect that European leaders are trying to get,\" Toygür said.What European countries really need, Toygür said, is a \"sustained defense investment that will make the continent more secure.\" She added that a \"sustained public backlash could create the opposite effect.\"NATO's 'quantum leap'NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte has hailed the increase as a \"quantum leap\" and said it \"laid the foundations for a stronger, fairer andmore lethal NATO.\"McGerty said the pledge was a \"significant commitment,\" particularly if European members manage to \"increase core defense spending to 3.5% of GDP\" —  up from the current average of 2%.The NATO agreementspecifies that 3.5% of GDP should \"resource core defense requirements\" and meet so-called NATO capability targets — a list of specific preparedness goals, from air defense to land maneuvers.According to NATO, the extra 1.5% of spending will, among other things, \"protect critical infrastructure, defend networks, ensure civil preparedness and resilience,  innovate, and strengthen the defense industrial base.\"NATO's defense goals include the purchase of fifth-generation fighter aircraft, improving air and missile defense, and ensuring combat readinessImage: U.S. Air Force/AP/dpa/picture allianceMcGerty said the pledge to bolster spending came \"at a time of considerable fiscal pressures\" for member states. However, she said, the 1.5% infrastructure element has a \"broad definition,\" which gives countries flexibility.\"Many countries are likely already spending this much on such funding areas,\" McGerty said.The debt problemThere are substantial doubts about the capacity of some member states to hit the agreed levels.According to NATO's most recent defense spending figures, from 2024, all but eight of the alliance's members were hitting the existing 2% target.A few have caught up in the meantime.Those furthest behind in terms of military spending — Spain, Belgium, Canada, Italy and Portugal — also have the problem of government debt of close to or even over 100% of their GDP.Greece is an outlier in that it has the highest debt level of all, but it already spends more than "

Donald Trump and Infantino have grown ever closer this year, ostensibly because of this revamped and expanded tournament and next year's World Cup, to be hosted in the USA, Canada and Mexico — an event many feel will be used by Trump to further push his message.\"He loves the game,\" Infantino said of the man who sat next to him at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey on Sunday. \"You cannot organize a competition like this without the full support of the government. Great thanks toPresident Trump– he has been fantastic.\"So too was Chelsea's Cole Palmer. The English attacking midfielder scored twice and made a third goal for Brazilian striker Joao Pedro to put European champions Paris Saint-Germain to the sword before halftime. PSG had no answer in the second half, as Chelsea cruised to victory.Big money tournamentInfantino's main measure of success for the Club World Cup, though, appears to be financial. He reported revenues of over $2 billion (€1.7 billion) and average earnings of $33 million per match for FIFA. Not bad for an organization whose remit is organization and promotion of the sport, rather than pure profit.FIFA aside, the biggest financial beneficiaries were the two teams that contested the final. Chelsea will get $40 million for the final alone while Paris Saint-Germain gets $30 million for the match, plus both get their share of the overall $1 billion prize pool. It's a sizable chunk, even for a team owned by an American private equity firm who bought it from asanctioned Russia oligarchandone owned by the oil-rich nation state of Qatar.A $250 million solidarity payment was also promised by FIFA \"to club football across the world.\"The fact that the final contained European teams who won two of three continental competitions in the season just finished is evidence of the primacy of European football. Three of the four semifinalists were European, as were the majority of the quarterfinalists. It remains to be seen how much a solidarity payment split between the rest of the teams in FIFA's 211 member states will impact the inequalities in the global game.Joao Pedro joined Chelsea during the tournament for a fee of about €64 millionImage: Brian Snyder/REUTERSThough Infantino has been effusive in his praise, many in the game have found failings with the first edition of a revamped competition pushed through by the FIFA boss.\"The Club World Cup is the worst idea ever implemented in football in this regard,\"German coach Jürgen Klopp, who coached Liverpool and Borussia Dortmund said during the tournament. \"People who have never had or do not have anything to do with day-to-day business anymore are coming up with something. There is insane money for participating, but it's also not for every club.\"Last year it was the Copa [America] and the European Championship, this year it's the Club World Cup, and next year theWorld Cup. That means no real recovery for the players involved, neither physically nor mentally.\"Players struggle in extreme temperaturesThe issue of exhaustion, echoed by many players, coaches and fans throughout the tournament, was exacerbated by theextreme temperatures in some of the matches.\"Honestly, the heat is incredible. The other day I had to lie down on the ground because I was really dizzy,\" said Chelsea midfielder Enzo Fernandez on the eve of the final. \"Playing in this temperature is very dangerous, it's very dangerous.\"Borussia Dortmundcoach Niko Kovac, meanwhile, described conditions for his team in Charlotte as being like \"a sauna\" in the group stage.Bayern Munich were one of the clubs who suffered in the heat at the Club World CupImage: Kai Pfaffenbach/REUTERSWhile there are mandated cooling breaks, Infantino has now said indoor air-conditioned stadiums will be used as much as possible for daytime kickoffs across the 16 venues that will host 2026 World Cup matches.

However, the burden falls on consumers within the US, as tariffs make imported goods more expensive and thus less competitive.\"Please understand that the 30% number is far less than what is needed to eliminate the Trade Deficit disparity we have with the EU,\" he added, referring to the difference in goods imported from the EU and goods exported to the EU.Trump invited the bloc to negotiate further, writing in his letter to European Commission PresidentUrsula von der Leyenthat high tariff rates would be dropped if \"the European Union, or countries within the EU, decide to build or manufacture within the United States.\"Trump has spent the week sending letters to trading partners, announcing new rates for a number of countries like Japan, South Korea, Canada andBrazil.EU faces dilemma as Trump renews tariff threat at 30%To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 videoTrump's tariff on EU goods: Where do things stand?Trump imposed a 20% import tax on all EU-made products in early April as part of a set of tariffs targeting countries with which the US has a trade imbalance.Hours after the nation-specific duties took effect, Trump put them on hold until July 9 at a standard rate of 10% in a bid to calm turbulent financial markets and allow time for negotiations.But the president expressed frustration at talks with the EU. In May, he threatened to impose a tariff rate of 50% on EU goods into the US.That would cause a price hike on everything from Italian leather goods to French cheese to German electronics in the US.Then Trump announced that universal tariffs that were due to kick in July 9 would be delayed until at least the beginning of August.The EU currently faces 50% US tariffs on its steel and aluminium exports, 25% on cars and car parts and 10% on most other products.Von der Leyen said few economies can match the EU's 'openness and adherence to fair trading practices'Image: Dursun Aydemir/Anadolu/picture allianceHow has the EU reacted?Ursula von der Leyen said the EU is prepared to take the necessary steps to safeguard its economic interests if the US proceeds with the 30% tariff rate.In a statement, the European Commission President said that the bloc remained ready \"to continue working towards an agreement by August 1.\"\"We will take all necessary steps to safeguard EU interests, including the adoption of proportionate countermeasures if required,\" she added.French PresidentEmmanuel Macronsaid his government shares the European Commission's \"very strong disapproval\" of Trump's announcement, which came despite \"weeks of intense engagement.\"\"France fully supports the European Commission in the negotiations, which will now intensify,\" Macron posted on X, adding that he still hopes \"a mutually acceptable agreement\" will be reached before August 1.The French president added that the bloc would need to speed up \"the preparation of credible countermeasures\" if no agreement is reached before the new tariffs take effect.The EU has the ability to enact the Anti-Coercion Instrument (ACI) which allows it to retaliate against countries seeking to pressure its members.

With Klara Bühl a constant threat, Germany's attack was fluid and menacing.Less than half an hour later, nobody was thinking about their attack. First, a heavy touch from Wamser and a total dereliction of duty from the rest of theGermandefense allowed Stina Blackstenius to run unchallenged in to the box and score. Next, a sharp run from Smilla Holmberg ended with a fortunate deflection to give Sweden the lead.Though theirtournamentprogression was all but assured before the game, Germany panicked. Goalkeeper Ann-Kathrin Berger, the most experienced of Germany's defense, gave a simple pass to opponent Johanna Rytting Kaneryd and got away with it. Moments later, Rytting Kaneryd was in again, this time finding Fridolina Rolfö whose shot was stopped by the hands of Wamser. The makeshift fullback was sent off, and Rolfö scored the resulting penalty.\"There was a sequence of behavior that wasn't good, we have to work on that,\" said Germany coach Christian Wück: \"The goal wasn't to concede four goals. That should be clear to everyone. We have to draw our conclusions from that.\"Germany finally pay defensive priceThough the speed of the implosion was a surprise, Germany's defensive frailties were clear from their wins against Poland and Denmark earlier in the group stage. Partly this is an issue of personnel. Berger, at 34, was a backup to Merle Frohms before her retirement, Wamser has spent most of her nascent career playing further forward and center back Rebecca Knaak, substituted at halftime, has just 7 caps at the age of 29.Sweden punished Germany for an error-strewn performanceImage: Martin Meissner/AP/picture allianceWückhas put his faith in Knaak, who had not played for her country until his appointment last year, but now must decide whether to replace her with Kathrin Hendrich, a 33-year-old who has been a regular in the German squad for some time and has plenty of tournament experience.His decision toomit another former Germany regular, leftback Felicitas Rauch, from the tournament squadwill also now come under further scrutiny. \"Not picking me is one thing. Not informing me and not even giving me a reason is something I simply don't understand. I would like to see much more transparent communication here,\" the 29-year-old wrote on Instagram after she was left out.The absence of star defensive midfielder Lena Oberdorf is also starting to be felt, withSjoeke Nüskensand Elisa Senss struggling to control matches for 90 minutes.Wück with work cut outWück cut his teeth with Germany's male youth teams and the scrutiny of a major tournament is a new challenge for him.Christian Wück lost his captain, Giulia Gwinn, to a knee injury in their Euro 2025 openerImage: Thomas Haesler/Kirchner-Media/dpa/picture allianceIn his time as senior women's coach so far, he has tried to introduce a progressive style of play building up from the back, often most evident in how much Berger plays out with the ball. His tactics also often oblige his defenders to deal with opponents in one on one situations when faced with counterattacks.While debutants Poland and a limited Danish side weren't able to take advantage of that, World Cup semifinalists Sweden were, adding a fourth when Lina Hurtig was allowed to tap in unchallenged on 80 minutes.It is only the second time Germany, who have won the tournament a record eight times, have lost a group game and the first time they have conceded four in a Euros macth. But Wück was defiant. \"We are down but we will get up again. It will take a few hours and then we will look forward to the quarterfinal,\" he said.With Wamser now suspended from the round of 16 match against the winners of group D (England, France or the Netherlands, who all play on Sunday), Berger looking shaky and Knaak struggling with the Swedes, Wück has some big decisions to make, even if they do only take a few hours.Edited by: Louis OelofseMatt PearsonSports reporter and editor@thisismpearsonSend us your feedbackYour feedbackAdvertisement"

Many sports organizations in Russia are connected to the army or the police.Referring to Velikaya's participation in Tbilisi, one senior European fencing official told DW: \"That for me is a total no-go.\" The official said they were \"outraged\" by the decision to scrap independent checks.The move has also sparked anger in Ukraine, which is still heavily under attack from Russia.\"This is a slap in the face not only toUkrainian athletes, but to the entire global sports community,\" said Mykhailo Ilyashev, the president of the Ukrainian Fencing Federation. \"We have emphasized from the very beginning that this whole process of testing Russian fencers for neutrality is a farce.\"Ukraine: Velikaya has no right to participateUkrainian sports officials have long campaigned against the participation of athletes from Russia and its ally Belarus in international events, even as neutrals.Velikaya (left) won silver in the 2016 Rio Olympics individual sabre and gold in the team eventImage: Ren Zhenglai/Xinhua/Photoshot/picture allianceFrom now on, the FIE will only require Russian and Belarusian fencers to sign a form confirming their neutrality, without any third-party oversight. The requirements include not making any public statements that support the war or participating in any pro-war rallies.The policy, announced in a letter to the FIE's member federations, breaks with one of the mainneutrality rules imposed by the International Olympic Committee (IOC)at the 2024 Paris Olympics.

She had never appeared on any vetted list of neutral athletes, and her inclusion at the world championships — alongside fellow CSKA members Yana Egorian and Olga Nikitina, who both also have military ranks — has shocked many observers.In June, Ukraine complained after Velikaya was nominated as a candidate for the FIE's athletes' commission, highlighting her rank of major and her role as an official campaigner for — \"a confidante of\" —Russian President Vladimir Putinin the 2024 presidential election.\"Such a person cannot be recognized as neutral and has no right to participate in the international sports movement — and even less to claim to represent the interests of athletes around the world,\" Ukraine's Sports Ministry wrote in a joint statement with the Ukrainian Olympic Committee and Ukrainian Fencing Federation.The ministry charged that \"aggressor countries are using sport not for dialogue and unity, but as a tool of propaganda.\"'Burdensome and particularly costly'Previously, similar to many international sports federations, the FIE hired a cybersecurity company and independent lawyer to verify information that it had collected on Russian and Belarusian fencers who applied for neutral status. At that time, the criteria for granting this was in line with theIOC's rules.Explaining its decision in the letter on July 7, the FIE called the vetting process \"burdensome and particularly costly,\" and said it wanted to \"simplify the process, to make it quicker and less expensive.\"Critics say fencing is unduly influenced by RussiaImage: Han Yuqing/Photoshot/picture allianceIt is the second time in three months that the FIE has gone against the IOC, having decided in April to allow teams of neutral athletes at its events, something that was not permitted in Paris.Asked by DW to comment on the FIE's diverging policies, the IOC replied that each sport's governing body \"is the sole authority for its international competitions, outside of the Olympic Games.\"The FIE didn't respond to a request for comment.Is Russian billionaire pulling strings?Observers say fencing has long been under Russia's influence.In March 2023, the sport was one of the first to readmit Russians and Belarusians as ne"

Is it performance? Or dofactors such as social backgroundplay a bigger role?The sociologist Michael Hartmann, an emeritus professor at Darmstadt University of Technology, has studied Germany's executive class as it evolved over the past 150 years, trying to figure out who ends up in top corporate positions and why.Hartmann told DW that the results surprised him. \"To this day, more than four-fifths of Germany's economic elite come from the top three to four percent of the population,\" he said.During the early 20th century, Germans were  slightly more able to improve their social statusImage: picture alliance/Mary Evans Picture LibraryHartmann said there was a slight shift between 1907 and 1927, with more Germans from lower classes managing to climb the social ladder. \"But, in the nearly 100 years that followed,\" he said, the share of those from lower social backgrounds who made it to the top increased by only about 2.5%.\"The 'right ones'Over the past decade, companies have introduceddiversity, equity andinclusion(DEI) programs to create a level playing field forlabor market participationfor all.According to a recent survey by the technology-sector lobby group Bitkom, two-thirds of German companies with 500 or more employees now have formal DEI goals, and roughly the other third are planning or discussing such initiatives.Still, when it comes to influential leadership positions, the elite tends to stick to its own. But, in recent years, more women have entered executive roles — thanks in large part to legally mandatedgender quotas, Hartmann said.The German-Swedish AllBright Foundation has criticizedthe continued gender imbalancein itslatest report.\"Personnel decisions for top management levels — especially supervisory board and executive board chair positions — are still almost entirely in male hands. In general, the higher the position, the fewer women are represented,\" the report stated.And those women who do reach the top often come from even more exclusive social backgrounds than their male peers, Hartmann said — something that would also apply to people with migrant backgrounds.\"My assumption is that if you already have one 'obstacle,' like, for example, gender or migration background, then your social origin has to be even more elitist,\" he said. People \"can't afford to have two obstacles,\" he added.Does class count more than merit?In Germany, class bias begins early, namely with the type of education. Children of academics have a far easier time accessing resources and support than children from working-class backgrounds.Education is an important credential for an executive career in GermanyImage: Brian Snyder/REUTERSAccording toa Germany study by British specialist recruitment firm PageGroup, about 80% of children from academic households go on to attend university, compared with just 25% or so of children from nonacademic homes.Without a university degree, Hartmann said, it's nearly impossible to reach the highest levels in the business world. But even when elite offspring achieve the same academic qualifications, their career path tends to be quicker and smoother than those with other backgrounds.After analyzing multiple cohorts of Germans with academic degrees, Hartmann has found that children of business executives who hold PhDs were 17 times more likely to make it onto the board of one of Germany's 400 largest companies than working-class children with the same degree.Moreover, additional factors would help determine who rises to the top — for example, how someone speaks, how they present themselves, and even their hobbies can play a decisive role.\"People like to surround themselves with others who share their interests, who think like them, who speak like them,\" Hartmann said, and that's true for the executives making hiring decisions, as well.Working-class children advanceThere has been one positive development in Germany in recent decades, Hartmann said, as the share of top leaders from working-class backgrounds has increased noticeably — though from a very low base.This progress has come at the expense of children from the middle class, Hartmann said. \"Put simply, when a working-class child achieves a high level of education and becomes a contender for a top business role, they often displace someone from the middle class — say, a teacher's child.\"Sociologist Hartmann has studied the role of merit in Germany's executive boardroomsImage: "

In very rare cases they can be deadly. Here’s what to know.https://p.dw.com/p/4xGL9One in eight people in the US have reported taking the weight loss drug Wegovy, also sold under the name Ozempic, since the drugs were first available in 2017.Image: JOEL SAGET/AFPAdvertisementOne in eight adults in the US have taken theweight loss drugs like Ozempic, according to survey analysis.But more than 30%of those drop the meds after just four weeks, according to a study by Blue Health Intelligence, a US healthcare data company, before the drug can have a meaningful impact on their health.Along withweight loss, Ozempic, which is also sold under the brand name Wegovy, has also won a reputation for its unpleasant side effects. The most common side effects people report are nausea, diarrhea or other digestive problems.Vision changes, erectile dysfunction and mood changes have also been reported, and you may have heard of side effect phenomena like ʺOzempic faceʺ or ʺOzempic buttʺ (sagging in all the wrong places).But what'sworrying medical professionalsmore are reports of severe medical illnesses after taking the weight loss drug, also called semaglutide or GLP-1 drugs, for several months.ʺThe most concerning side effects include pancreatitis and the effects on musculoskeletal disorders,ʺ Penny Ward, a physician-doctor at Kings College London, UK, told DW.A UK regulator has highlighted potentially deadly side effects of acute pancreatitis — an inflammation of the pancreas — after at least ten deaths were linked to this condition among British users of GLP-1 drugs.Side effects after clinical trials 'not unusual'GLP-1 drugs have been on the US market since 2017. Ozempic was first approved to treat type 2 diabetes, while Wegovy was approved as a weight-loss medication in 2021.Clinical trials testing their safety and effectiveness showed them to be safe enough for their intended users. But since being release to the public, people have been reporting new side effects that hadn't appeared in the original clinical trials.Ward said it's ʺnot unusualʺ for additional adverse reactions to be noted once a product goes into clinical use.ʺRarer side effects may emerge as more patients take these medicines in clinical practice,ʺ she said, \"simply as a result of the much larger number of people treated than were included in the clinical development trials.ʺThis is why we continue to monitor the safety of medicines on the market,ʺ Ward added.A major studypublished in the journalNature Medicinein January 2025 set out to systematically analyze all the reported health risks of over 215,000 people taking GLP-1 drugs to treatdiabetes.The researchers found risks of taking GLP-1 drugs beyond those previously recognized in clinical trials, including an 11% increased risk in arthritis and a 146% increased risk of pancreatitis. Increased risks of low blood pressure, dizziness or fainting, kidney stones and kidney inflammation were also reported.The study also highlighted well-known risks of several gastrointestinal disorders, backing up numerous past studies showing an increased risk of gastrointestinal side effects.More research on side effects neededLast year, people also started reporting that they'd gone blind after taking Wegovy. Researchers who investigated the matter found that GLP-1 drugs are associated with an increased risk of a disease affecting the optic nerve, called nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION).While the condition is rare, affecting an estimated 10 in 100,000 people, astudy published in the journalJAMA Ophthalmologyfound that people with diabetes taking GLP-1 drugs are four times more likely to develop NAION than the population average.ʺThis research does suggest an association between semaglutide treatment and one form of sight-threatening optic neuropathy, but this would ideally be tested in larger studies,ʺ Graham McGeown, an honorary professor of physiology at Queen's University Belfast, UK.Experts say much more research is needed in representative populations to better understand the side effects of GLP-1 drug and their real-world risks for people taking them.ʺFor example, [more data is needed about] those taking the drug for obesity, who need a higher dose compared to people with diabetes, and taking it for longer than two years,ʺ said Karolina Skibicka, a neuroendocrinologist at University of Calgary, Canada.ʺBut especially, we need studies which include women. Women show unique side-effects to many pharmacotherapies, and still [in] most studies women are often underrepresented at various stages of testing,ʺ Skibicka added.Weight loss injectionTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 videoBenefits outweigh the "

He is unsure whether he will even compete the upcoming World Championships in Rwanda.https://p.dw.com/p/4xCqyGirmay Biniam has a lot to live up to after a successful 2024Image: Roth/CV-SG/picture allianceAdvertisementLast year, Africa's most prominent cyclist,Biniam Girmay, won three sprint stages in theTour de Franceand took home the green jersey for the best points-scoring rider, usually a sprinter. He was the first black professional cyclist from Africa to do any of these things, marking a historic moment for African cycling and his home country ofEritrea. In Asmara, the capital, Girmay was welcomed with a motorcade as people danced and cheered for their hero.This year, even though fans from Eritrea continue to celebrate him despite being thousands of miles away, Girmay has found life on the Tour a bit more challenging.Form is true, but success remains elusiveNevertheless, he finished second in the opening stage behind the Belgian Jasper Philipsen.\"I felt good and enjoyed the day,\" Girmay told DW afterward. \"But I had to do everything on my own, so I used up a lot of energy. And Jasper was the fastest in the end.\"Despite converting his good form into a second-place finish, the 25-year-old wasn't that happy. \"I'm a bit disappointed,\" said Girmay. \"I would at least have liked to have had a teammate with me. That has to get better. But it is what it is. We're at the Tour de France and not everything will always go perfectly.\"Things have not gone quite so well in the subsequent stages, with Girmay slowed by a knee injury. Despite that, he still has big goals ahead: He wants to win at least one stage again and fight for the green jersey.A more mature personDoes the pressure of having to repeat last year's success weigh on him?\"No, it just gives me motivation,\" replied the sprint specialist from Eritrea. \"I've spoken to a few guys who have been there many times and they say that winning just one stage is super tough. And I had three in one year. That gives me a lot of confidence for the rest of my career.\"Despite his success, Girmay has not changed as a person, according to people close to him.\"There are more people who want something from him. But he's still the same,\" his coach and sporting director Aike Visbeek said. \"His career is progressing fast. But it's not so much the green jersey that has changed him, but more the fact that he is a maturing young man.\"In 2024, Girmay (second from the right) shared the final podium with the overall winner Tadej Pogacar (right, in yellow)Image: Bruno Bebert/Bestimage/IMAGOThis mature young athlete is aware of hisspecial role as a representative of Africa.\"I want to do the best for myself and my family first,\" said Girmay. \"Unfortunately, I'm the only rider from Africa this year.

But for me, the course is far beyond my own capabilities,\" said Girmay at the beginning of the year. \"I don't know if I would even make it to the finish. There's no point in competing then.\"But he left one door open. If his country called him, he would be there.Biniam Girmay in action in the second stage of the 2025 Tour de France, a competition that is proving harder for the Eritrean than in 2024Image: Jan De Meuleneir/Photo News/IMAGODuring the Tour de France, Girmay did not want to say anything about the World Championships. But coach Visbeek is still skeptical.\"He [Girmay] is still disappointed with the course. I don't think you really help the African cyclists with a course like this. You make it very difficult and that's sad,\" he told DW.Right now, though, Girmay is entirely focused on the Tour de France. Thanks to his participation in the intermediate sprints, he is still in the running for the green jersey. He has also not had any serious crashes so far, unlike the winner of the first stage,Philipsen, who is out.

If apeace deal that was signed in Junebetween the country and neighboring Rwanda holds, enduring violence could recede and citizens could have a fresh chance to play or watch sport.The eastern region of the 11th biggest country in the world has been dogged by violence for the past 30 years, which has, according to the Council on Foreign Relations, resulted in the deaths of approximately six million people. Fighting escalated earlier this year asM23, a rebel paramilitary groupthat, according to the Congo and theUnited Nations, is backed byRwanda, made inroads against the Congolese army.Details of the peace plan, brokered by the United States, may be currently vague with concerns over whether it can hold and the low levels of trust between the two parties, but the prospect of stability is a welcome one.\"One hopes that eventually this [peace deal] will be implemented,\" said Murithi Mutiga, Africa Program Director at the International Crisis Group. \"With luck, and also concerted diplomatic efforts, Congo may reach its potential.\"How peace could score for the 'beautiful game'If the fighting stops, football can resume all over the country.\"A peace deal needs to be sorted because a number of the clubs that are based in the east of the country have not been able to play as a result of the recent conflict and invasion,\" Guy Burton, an international research analyst on conflict and peace, told DW.\"Ultimately for the game to flourish, you need to have stability, you need to have peace.

Here's how the death cap became the center of a chilling murder case.https://p.dw.com/p/4x8P8Even small amounts of death cap mushrooms are lethal if consumed.Image: Hans Reinhard/Okapia/picture-allianceAdvertisementA jury in Australia has found Erin Patterson guilty on three counts of murder and one of attempted murder. The murder weapon: Toxic mushrooms.Prosecutors argued Patterson intentionally served four of her family members with meal portions containing toxic death cap mushrooms in 2023.Patterson denied being guilty, originally telling police she had used store-bought mushrooms from a supermarket, then an Asian grocer in Melbourne. A search of such stores found no evidence that poisonous mushrooms had ever been sold.During the trial, Patterson said she may have foraged for the mushrooms but could not say for certain where she had obtained the death caps.Why are death cap mushrooms so deadly?Deadly by name and by nature, death cap mushrooms (Amanita phalloides)are full of a highly stable toxin called alpha-Amanitin. The toxin is so stable that it won't break down when exposed to heat in cooking.When a death cap is eaten, people don’t usually feel symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea until at least 6 hours later.During this time the alpha-Amanitin toxins are making their way through the bloodstream into organs of the body.The toxin primarily acts in the liver, where it causes cells in the liver to die. Alpha-Amanitin binds with RNA polymerase-II enzymes, preventing the cells from creating new proteins. Eventually, the liver starts to shut down. Death can occur within 24 hours.Careful identification requiredThe Amanita genus of fungi is well-known for their toxic properties. This group include the fairytale \"toadstool\" commonly known as the fly agaric, death caps, and \"destroying angels\". But some other Amanita mushrooms are edible.Most cases of death cap poisoning areoften a case of misidentification— their classic white appearance and domed cap looks like many other types of fungi.Identification of mushrooms requires a knowledge of different parts of the anatomy: the cap or fruiting body, the gills or spores beneath the cap, and the stipe — or stalk.While death caps look like many other mushrooms, one defining characteristic is their bad smell.\"They don't store well at all, unless you dehydrate them. They quickly go very stinky and very nasty,\" Brett Summerell, a fungi expert and Chief Scientist at the Botanic Gardens of Sydney, Australia, told DW.Because of the risk of misidentification by amateurs, it's usually recommended that foragers go for edible species that cannot be mistaken. Of course, foraging under the supervision of a trained mycologist — a fungi scientist — is usually a safe option.The famous red and white \"toadstool\" is a member of the Amanita genus, and a cousin of other deadly mushroom species.Image: FABRICE COFFRINI/AFPNo death caps in the supermarketThe jury ultimately didn’t find Patterson’s defense — that she mixed up foraged mushrooms in the same container as store-bought ones — believable.The prosecution argued Patterson knowingly put the toxic mushrooms in the home-cooked lunch and disposed of evidence.Summerell said the likelihood that death caps could get into store-bought products \"is, to be honest, farcical.\"The reason? Death caps only grow next to oak and beech trees.Death caps, like many fungi, are mycorrhizal, meaning they have a symbiotic relationship with the tree species. Death caps obtain their nutrients from nearby tree roots and return nutrients to the nearby soil.But because they can only grow at the base of oak and beech trees, it means there's no chance of them sprouting in a commercial setting, where spores are cultivated in highly controlled conditions — and with no trees in sight.Australia could get rid of death capsDeath caps aren’t native toAustralia, and neither are the oak and beech trees that support them. The trees were first introduced into Australia from Europe in the 19th ecntury, and death caps in the 1960s.Summerell and other mycologists are now discussing the possibility of removing oak trees in some parts of Australia.\"We have argued that, in Sydney, if it's at all possible, we should start to think about removing oak trees from some of these suburbs just from the point of view of a public health risk,\" said Summerell.Removing introduced oaks could harbor positive benefits, both from a public health perspective by removing the risk of the top cause of mushroom poisoning, as well as providing more space for native Australian plant life.Edited by: Fred SchwallerMatthew Ward AgiusJournalist reporting on politics, health, history, science, climate and environment.Send us your feedbackYour feedbackAdvertisement"

How far is global warming driving these events?https://p.dw.com/p/4xAVkOutdoor workers, such as those in construction, are particularly at risk during heatwavesImage: Christophe Archambault/AFPAdvertisementIn late June and early July,a heatwave swept through Europebringing with it  temperatures of over 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) in many countries.The sweltering heat forced schools to close, prompted bans on outdoor work across most of Italy, and created hot, dry conditions that fueledwildfiresin several countries.

Besser/ALMA/AFPAccording to meteorological services in the region, many weather stations set new records with some falling below –15 degrees Celcius. Governments were forced to restrict gas supplies after electricity demand caused cuts and move homeless people to emergency shelters.What’s behind the extremes?The cold snap in southern South America was due to what is known as a powerful polar-origin anticyclone.\"What happened this week in Chile and the Southern Cone in general is a cold wave caused by an escape of a polar air mass from Antarctica,\" climatologist Raul Cordero from the University of Santiago told the AFP.Another meteorologist told the news agency that the rarity of the event in this region made it hard to rule out the possibility of the cold snap being related to climate change.Some researchers have proposed that Arctic warming could disrupt patterns of atmospheric circulation, leading to cold polar air flooding out of the regions. However, many climate scientists argue that extreme cold spells in temperate regions are decreasing in a warming world, and have dropped in intensity and frequency in recent decades.Theblistering temperatures in Europe, however, were fueled by the emergence of a “heat dome\", a meteorological phenomenon where high-pressure keeps dry, hot air over one region for a long period of time.Temperatures of over 40C were felt across Europe during late June and early JulyImage: Petros Giannakouris/AP Photo/picture allianceJohn Marsham, Joint-Chair of the Met Office, the UK’s meteorological service, at the University of Leeds, UK said the role of climate change in the recent high temperatures in Europe is absolutely certain.“One of the strongest fingerprints ofclimate changeis the increase in extremes and that's particularly true for heat waves and high temperature extremes,\" said Marsham.Climate change is believed to have tripled the number of heat-related deaths in the recent European heatwave,according to a rapid studyled by scientists at Imperial College London and the London School of Tropical Medicine.Scientists say climate change tripled the number of heat-related deaths in the heatwaveImage: Halil Sagirkaya/Anadolu/IMAGOThe study estimatesthe burning of fossil fuelsincreased the temperatures in the heatwave by up to 4C across 12 European cities, increasing the number of expected heat-deaths by 1,500.\"Heatwaves don’t leave a trail of destructionlike wildfiresor storms,\" said Ben Clarke, research at the Centre for Environmental Policy at Imperial College London. \"Their impacts are mostly invisible but quietly devastating — a change of just 2 or 3°C can mean the difference between life and death for thousands of people.\"The EU’s Copernicus stated thatduring the heatwave, large parts of southern Europe experienced an unusually high number of \"tropical nights\"  — where temperatures remain above 20° C (68 degrees Fahrenheit). This can pose a health risk by preventing the body recovering from daytime heat.In the future Europe will for sure experience more heatwaves and more intense heatwaves, said Lara Wallberg, climate scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany. \"Heat extremes that are now rare events might be very, very common at the end of"

For the third time since 2017, an interstellar object will enter our solar system. What is it and are we prepared?https://p.dw.com/p/4wxhm3I/ATLAS caught by astronomers: The visitor from another planetary system is no common thingImage: David Rankin/AFPAdvertisementBeyond the fact that this is the third known interstellar object to have entered our solar system, \"we don't know very much,\" said Larry Denneau, co-principle investigator at ATLAS,a telescope in Chilethat spotted 3I/ATLAS on July 1, 2025.It's not exactly reassuring when scientists say \"we don't know,\" but at least it's honest.Astronomers do know that 3I/ATLAS is a comet that's about 670 million kilometers (416 million miles) away from the sun. Based on current projections, it posesno danger to planet Earth.\"Scientists are still determining the velocity and trajectory to a degree that will allow accurate predictions for the future,\" wrote Richard Moissl, who heads theEuropean Space Agency's Planetary Defense office, in an email to DW.The closest it will get to our planet is about 240 million kilometers away, when it will fly by in October. That is more than 1.5 times the distance between us andthe sun, and about 624 times the distance between the Earth and ourmoon. It is also thought to be about 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) wide and traveling at about 60 kilometers per second (an impressive 134,000 miles per hour).But this is all relatively basic data — the very data that allowed astronomers at the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System in Chile to spot it. When they saw the object on an unusual trajectory, they immediately began to track and measure it.Then, other astronomers based at telescopes in Hawaii and Australia, began monitoring the object's flight progress and confirmed it as an interstellar comet.\"We are seeing an onset of [normal] cometary activity,\" wrote Moissl.Trajectory of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS as it passes through the solar systemImage: NASA/JPL-Caltech/REUTERSOpen questions about comet 3I/ATLAS?Comet 3I/ATLAS flew through the heliosphere to enter our solar system. The heliosphere is a barrier that protects us from interstellar winds and radiation.The heliosphere is, however, an imperfect barrier — some interstellar radiation gets through, and it clearly doesn't stop icy intergalactic wanderers like 3I/ATLAS.Interstellar objects in our solar system are thought to be quite rare though. The first known interstellar object was 1I/'Oumuamua, detected in 2017, and 2I/Borisov, detected in 2019.\"This is only the third interstellar [object] ever to be detected, hence a precise forecast of the expected frequency is not possible at this point,\" wrote Moissl.But telescopes have got more technologically advanced and scientists do now scan the night sky continuously. So we may begin to see more of them.\"The Legacy Survey in Space and Time at the Vera Rubins telescope in Chile goes online this year. It is more efficient than existing surveys and expected to detect several new Interstellar objects over the next 10 years,\" said Moissl's colleague at ESA, Michael Kueppers.Kueppers is a Comet Interceptor Project scientist. Comet Interceptor is a spacecraft that will rest in a \"parking orbit\" and intercept distant comets and asteroids if they come too close to Earth. It's scheduled to launch in 2029.Where did comet 3I/ATLAS come from?The short (and obvious) answer is that comets, like 3I/ATLAS, 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, come from other planetary systems.`Oumuamua: Is that really an asteroid?To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 videoMuch likecomets and asteroidswithin our solar system, interstellar objects are considered to be untouched specimens from elsewhere in our galaxy, the Milky Way, if not fragments from the very beginnings of the universe.Moissl said this new object \"came roughly from the direction of the Galactic Center region,\" which, as the name suggests, is towards the center of the Milky Way. But astronomers do not know its precise origin or \"home star.\"Based on its brightness, 3I/ATLAS appears to be bigger than the other two stray comets — 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov — which are thought to have entered our solar system from a different region of the Milky Way.Astronomers will want to continue monitoring 3I/ATLAS to assess its composition and behavior. ESA said that as an active comet, it may heat up as it gets closer to Earth, and \"sublimate\" — that's when frozen gases on a comet turn into vapor, creating a glowing coma and trail of dust and ice particles.You should be able to see it from Earth with a telescope by September — but \"you'll need a big telescope to see it,\" wrote Jonathan McDowell of the Ha"

It's also a medical issue when menopause starts a decade earlier than the global average.https://p.dw.com/p/4x6ciStudies report that education about menopause is generally inadequate worldwide, leaving many women to find out for themselvesImage: Tim Graham/picture allianceAdvertisementSumrin Kalia, a Pakistani woman living abroad, married at 18 and had four children by the time she was 25. She experienced no sign, no overt symptoms of menopause until she did, suddenly and early, at the age of 37.\"I began experiencing excessive bleeding. I went to a doctor, who told me I might be perimenopausal,\" Kalia, who is now in her mid-40s, told DW.TheWorld Health Organizationputs the global average age for menopause at between 45 and 55 years.\"No one explained it to me. It was very sudden. I started bleeding heavily and more frequently than usual,\" Kalia said.Kalia had been using an intrauterine device (IUD) forbirth control. She had it removed, and her periods stopped altogether without explanation.Her experience was shared by other South Asian women who spoke to DW. They had their own stories to tell of how they had experienced perimenopause symptoms sooner than their global peers.Menopause on a faster clock: The big pictureA US-based study found South Asian American women reported an average menopause age of 48 or 49 years. For the general US population, the average age at which menopause begins is 52 years.In South Asia itself, the average is lower than in the US. InIndiaandPakistan, women enter menopause at around 46 to 47, and they encounter perimenopausal symptoms before that, as is common for menopause.Meanwhile, Pakistan's average number of children per woman has dropped sharply from 3.61 in 2023 to 3.19 in 2024, reflecting shifting fertility patterns. By comparison, India's rate declined more modestly from 2.14 to 2.12.Whether or how the two sets of data are connected is unclear, but there are indications that a number of factors may be coming together to affect the aging process of South Asian women.Taking women's health seriously — In Good ShapeTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 videoGenetics, biology, and vitamin D deficiencyHormonal healthexpert Palwasha Khan, a consultant physician based in Pakistan, explained that menopause timing is partly genetic.\"There's no exact rule, but studies show women tend to start and end their periods around the same age as their mothers,\" Khan told DW. \"The earlier you start menstruating, the earlier menopause is likely to occur.\"Khan also highlighted a lesser-known factor: a rapid depletion of vitamin D levels among South Asian women, which can worsen chronic health issues linked to aging.Furthermore, Khan said that many women experience ovarian failure in their late 30s or 40s, often compounded by \"undiagnosed medical issues\" and a lack of quality health care earlier in life.A cultural pressure cooker: Fertility over healthIn South Asia, and particularly in Pakistan, societal expectations push women to have children soon after marriage, often at the cost of their long-term health.\"Women's health as a distinct concern is largely ignored,\" Khan said. Awareness around hormonal health is minimal, and treatments like hormone replacement therapy (HRT) are rare. \"You'd have to pick 10,000 women to find two who've gone on [HRT].\"This intense focus on fertility often sidelines conversations about menopause and women's well-being.Another story: The emotional cost of menopauseSabina Qazi, a Pakistani woman in her mid-40s, based in Karachi, told DW about the emotional and cognitive challenges she faced as a cost of menopause.\"My husband and children would talk to me, but the words would just fall off in between... I had the constant need to prove that I wasn't stupid,\" she Qazi, describing the cognitive difficulties she experienced after undergoing a radical hysterectomy, a procedure in which her uterus, fallopian tubes, and both ovaries were removed due tocancer risk.Qazi said her biggest frustration with the medical process — a form of surgical menopause — was how little thought was given to the long-term consequences. Although the surgery was preventive, she felt the emotional weight of the decision was never fully acknowledged.In fact, the procedure was framed as inevitable, a foregone conclusion: She would reach menopause regardless, in a few years time, so, why not get it over with now?Qazi later began hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to manage her menopause symptoms. She said one of the most persistent challenges was dealing with brain fog.While her menopause followed a medically required hysterectomy, the overlap between surgical menopause and broader health risks reflects a pattern that medical consultant Khan "

It does not allow deep-sea mining, though it has issued some exploration permits.As the seabed is known to hold rich deposits of minerals like copper, cobalt, and nickel,mineralsconsidered important for EV batteries and a green energy transition, deep-sea is very attractive for mining enterprises like TMC.The company and the Trump adminitration have framed any mining activity off the back of the president's April executive order as a matter of national security and a way to compete withChina, which dominates therare earth elementsmarket.But scientists, legal experts and industry analysts are warning that the risks to the climate, international law, and the ocean itself, may outweigh the rewards.The same story, deeper waters?This isn't the first time Gerrard Barron, CEO of The Metals Company has made a bold bet to mine the ocean. A decade ago, he was an early investor in a Canadian company called Nautilus Minerals, that pledged to extract metals including copper and gold from the seabed off the Pacific Island state of Papua New Guinea.A little over a decade after going public on the Toronto Stock Exchange in 2007 and raising hundreds of millions from investors, Nautilus went bankrupt without ever commerically mining the sea. Barron bailed early and reportedly left with approximately $30 million. But Papua New Guinea, which has limited resources to invest in infrastructure, education, or health, was left with rusting equipment and over $120 million (€101 million) in public losses — in keeping with exchange rates of the time.Deep-sea mining: New battleground for critical mineralsTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 videoTMC began its current journey as DeepGreen, founded in 2011 by Nautilus Minerals' former CEO David Heydon. Gerrard Barron later took over, became CEO and ahead of its public listing in 2021, rebranded the enterprise as The Metals Company.This time, the idea is to mine the high seas, otherwise known as international waters. To do so, TMC acquired subsidiaries in the three small Pacific nations of Nauru, Tonga and Kiribati. Acting as state sponsors, they applied for ISA exploration contracts in the Clarion‑Clipperton Zone — an international seabed rich in polymetallic nodules. Though deep-sea mining there had not been sanctioned, the ISA was considering easing the rules.A company under pressureBy late 2023, TMC faced a double bind. The ISA had not established rules for commercial mining, and a growing list of European governments, includingGermany,SpainandSwedenas well as several Pacific Island states, had declared national moratoria or \"precautionary pauses\" on the practice. TMC's stock value tumbled in response, and the Nasdaq stock market index threatened delisting.So, The Metals Company changed tactics, according to information compiled by Greenpeace Germany investigation unit and the US-based anti-corruption nonprofit Anti-Corruption Data Collective.Data seen and analyzed by DW shows that TMC shifted its lobbying strategy from ocean-policy committees, where environmental resistance was strongest, towards US defense and national security officials. Urging that seabed minerals were not just agreen-techresource but a national-security weapon against China.In an earlier interview with DW, Barron said, \"Trump being elected was very good news for us.\" Indeed, just weeks"

It will have no critical dependencies on non-EU infrastructure, and the AWS European Sovereign Cloud is operated only by personnel who are European Union (EU) residents located in the EU, subject to EU law.Based on evolving customer requirements for digital sovereignty in Europe, we are adding EU citizenship to our hiring requirements for AWS European Sovereign Cloud employees operating the cloud. Our EU citizen personnel will work from EU locations subject to EU law, as before. We continue to offer customers more choice and control, so that they don't have to compromise on the full power of AWS to spark innovation, drive economic growth, and strengthen cybersecurity protection.The AWS European Sovereign Cloud is designed to provide customers with an autonomous cloud that operates independently in Europe and for Europe. Replicating a broadly practiced mitigation mechanism that is established in EU institution and government hiring practices, operational control and access will be restricted to EU citizens located in the EU to ensure that all operators have enduring ties to the EU and to meet the needs of our customers and partners.To assure independent operation of the AWS European Sovereign Cloud, these new hiring requirements will apply to personnel who will have control of day-to-day operations, including access to data centers, technical support, and customer service.As we make this change, we will continue to work as a blended team of EU residents and EU citizens, with all personnel working from EU locations, before gradually completing our transition to EU citizen operations for the AWS European Sovereign Cloud. We are committed to supporting any employees impacted by this transition, and redeploying builders who do not meet the EU citizen eligibility requirement into other roles within Amazon.We remain on track to launch the AWS European Sovereign Cloud by the end of 2025. This initiative, which is backed by a€7.8 billion investmentthrough 2040, represents our deep commitment to meeting Europe's evolving digital sovereignty needs.You can learn more about the AWS European Sovereign Cloud onaws.eu.Related TagsAmazon Web Services"

Still,stretched-thinHR teams say it’s the only way to handlethousandsof applicants.The next time you get buttoned-up and sit down for a long-awaited job interview, you might not find a human on the other end of the call. Instead, job hunters are now joiningZoommeetings only tobe greeted byAI interviewers. Candidates tellFortunethey’re either confused, intrigued, or straight-up dejected when the robotic, faceless bots join the calls.“Looking for a job right now is so demoralizing and soul-sucking, that to submit yourself to that added indignity is just a step too far,” Debra Borchardt, a seasoned writer and editor who has been on the job hunt for three months, tellsFortune.“Within minutes, I was like, ‘I don’t like this. This is awful.’ It started out normal…Then it went into the actual process of the interview, and that’s when it got a little weird.”AI interviewers are only the newestchange to thehiring process that hasbeen upendedby the advanced technology. With HR teams dwindling and hiring managers tasked to reviewthousands ofapplicants for a single role, they’reoptimizing theirjobsby using AI tofilter top applicants, schedule candidate interviews, and automate correspondence about next steps in the process. AI interviewers may be a godsend for middle managers, but job seekers see them as only another hurdle in theintense hunt forwork.The experience for some job hunters has been so poor that they’re swearing off interviews conducted by AI altogether. Candidates tellFortunethat AI interviewers make them feel unappreciated to the point where they’d rather skip out on potential job opportunities, reasoning the company’s culture can’t be great if human bosses won’t make the time to interview them. But HR experts argue the opposite: Since AI interviewers can help hiring managers save time in first-round calls, the humans have more time to have more meaningful conversations with applicants down the line.Job seekers and HR are starkly divided on how they feel about the tech, but one thing is fact—AI interviewers aren’t going anywhere.“The truth is, if you want a job, you’re gonna go through this thing,” Adam Jackson, CEO and founder of Braintrust, a company that distributes AI interviewers, tellsFortune.“If there were a large portion of the job-seeking community that were wholesale rejecting this, our clients wouldn’t find the tool useful…This thing would be chronically underperforming for our clients. And we’re just not seeing that—we’re seeing the opposite.”Job seekers are dodging AI interviewersSocial media has beenexploding withjob seekers detailing their AI interviewerexperiences: describing bots hallucinating andrepeating questionson end, calling the roboticconversations awkward, or saying it’s less nerve-racking than talking to a human. Despite how much hiring managers love AI interviewers, job seekers aren’t sold on the idea just yet.Allen Rausch, a 56-year-old technical writer who has worked atAmazonandElectronic Arts, has been on the job hunt for two months since getting laid off from his previous role at InvestCloud. In looking for new opportunities, he was “startled” to run into AI interviewers for the first time—let alone on three occasions for separate jobs. All of the meetings would last up to 25 minutes, and featured woman-like cartoons with female voices. It asked basic career questions, running through his résumé and details about the job opening, but couldn’t answer any of his questions on the company or culture.Rausch says he’s only open to doing more AI interviews if they don’t test his writing skills, and if human connection is guaranteed at some point later in the process.“Given the percentage of responses that I’m getting to just basic applications, I think a lot of AI interviews are wasting my time,” he tellsFortune.“I would probably want some sort of a guarantee that, ‘Hey, "

fewer uses of compiler builtinsStandard library contains lots of language features that are usually implemented in the compilerrecent talk onGPUMODEValue Semantics and Automatic BufferizationMost of the major ML frameworks have value semantics for arrays by default, and it gives the compiler much more leeway when it comes to memory.\nNot only is manual memory management a huge pain and a source of bugs, if the ownership semantics are not sufficiently represented in the language or the language defaults are not ammenable to optimization, the compiler will have a much harder time generating performant code.My understanding of the Rust borrow checker is that its purpose is to handle the intersection of manual memory management and strict ownership.\nUsers choose between value and reference semantics, and the compiler helps you keep track of ownership.\nSummarized as“aliasing xor mutability”.Thanks Steve, for helping clarify the Rust bits!Fortran’s Array SemanticsIn a way, value semantics and automatic bufferization of arrays is part of why Fortran compilers are able to generate such performant code.When you use an array in Fortran, you are not just getting a pointer to a contiguous block "

The six-wheeled robot has been given more autonomy and the ability to multitask — improvements designed to make the most of Curiosity’s energy source, a multi-mission radioisotope thermoelectric generator (MMRTG). Increased efficiency means the rover has ample power as it continues to decipher how the ancient Martian climate changed, transforming a world of lakes and rivers into the chilly desert it is today.Curiosity recently rolled into a region filled withboxwork formations. These hardened ridges are believed to have been created by underground water billions of years ago. Stretching for miles on this part ofMount Sharp, a 3-mile-tall (5-kilometer-tall) mountain, the formations might reveal whether microbial life could have survived in the Martian subsurface eons ago, extending the period of habitability farther into when the planet was drying out.NASA’s Curiosity viewed this rock shaped like a piece of coral on July 24, 2025, the 4,608th Martian day of the mission. The rover has found many rocks that — like this one — were formed by minerals deposited by ancient water flows combined with billions of years of sandblasting by wind.Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSSCarrying out this detective work involves a lot of energy. Besides driving and extending a robotic arm to study rocks and cliffsides, Curiosity has a radio, cameras, and 10 science instruments that all need power. So do the multiple heaters that keep electronics, mechanical parts, and instruments operating at their best. Past missions like theSpiritandOpportunityrovers and theInSightlander relied on solar panels to recharge their batteries, but that technology always runs the risk of not receiving enough sunlight to provide power.View This Article in 3D Space!Visit Eyes on the News (Beta)Instead, Curiosity and its younger siblingPerseveranceeach use theirMMRTGnuclear power source, which relies on decaying plutonium pellets to create energy and recharge the rover’s batteries. Providing ample power for the rovers’ many science instruments, MMRTGs are known for their longevity (the twinVoyagerspacecraft have relied onRTGssince 1977). But as the plutonium decays over time, it takes longer to recharge Curiosity’s batteries, leaving less energy for science each day.The team carefully manages the rover’s daily power budget, factoring in every device that draws on the batteries. While these components were all tested extensively before launch, they are part of complex systems that reveal their quirks only after years in the extreme Martian environment. Dust, radiation, and sharp temperature swings bring out edge cases that engineers couldn’t have expected.“We were more like cautious parents earlier in the mission,” said Reidar Larsen of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, which built and operates the rover. Larsen led a group of engineers who developed the new capabilities. “It’s as if our teenage rover is maturing, and we’re trusting it to take on more responsibility. As a kid, you might do one thing at a time, but as you become an adult, you learn to multitask.”More Efficient ScienceGenerally, JPL engineers send Curiosity a list of tasks to complete one by one before the rover ends its day with a nap to recharge. In 2021, the team began studying whether two or three rover tasks could be safely combined, reducing the amount of time Curiosity is active.For example, Curiosity’s radio regularly sends data and images to a passing orbiter, whichrelays them to Earth. Could the rover talk to an orbiter while driving, moving its robotic arm, or snapping images? Consolidating tasks could shorten each day’s plan, requiring less time with heaters on and instruments in a ready-to-use state, reducing the energy used. Testing showed Curiosity safely could, and all of these have now been successfully demonstrated on Mars.Get the JPL NewsletterFrom Mars to the Milky Way—never miss a discovery!

    "full_content": "Elon Musk says he’s bringing back Vine — sort of. The X ownerannouncedover the weekend that the company discovered the video archive for the popular short-form video app, thought to have been deleted, and is working to restore user access.Vine — something of a precursor to today’s TikTok, but with only six-second-long looping videos — wasacquired by Twitter back in October 2012for $30 million to expand the social media platform’s video ambitions. Unfortunately for Vine creators and fans, the company fumbled the app’s potential and decided toshut down Vine in 2016by limiting all new uploads. The following year, it was fully discontinued, though auser archiveremained for a time.Despite no longer having an App Store presence, Vine still has a place in the internet’s collective cultural consciousness. Through online compilations of the best Vines uploaded to YouTube, and through the careers of numerous creators who got their start on Vine, the company lives on to some extent, and its content continues to be discovered by new generations.Musk himself seemed interested in bringing back Vine afteracquiring Twitter in October 2022. Ina poll postedon the social media app, he asked Twitter’s users, “Bring back Vine?” to which nearly 70% responded “yes.”Axios reported at the timethat Twitter had devoted some engineers to working on the Vine reboot, but nothing ever came of it.Grok Imagine is AI Vine!Btw, we recently found the Vine video archive (thought it had been deleted) and are working on restoring user access, so you can post them if you want.— Elon Musk (@elonmusk)August 2, 2025It’s unclear whether Musk has any ambitions for Vine beyond getting its archive back online, however. In the same post about restoring Vine, he also touted that Grok’s new video-creation feature, Grok Imagine, also available to X Premium+ subscribers, is “AI Vine.” That suggests that his interests in video creation no longer lie with human creativity, but in human-directed AI prompting.Whether or not Musk will actually deliver on the promise remains to be seen, as the X post could have just been another way to draw attention to Grok AI, rather than being representative of a real effort inside the company to make old Vines available for reposting.Techcrunch eventTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agendaNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

What’s changing is that the company is separating the teams that oversee Wondery’s narrative podcast efforts from those developing its creator-led shows.Wondery is combining its narrative podcast studio, which includes podcasts like Dr. Death and American Scandal, with Audible.“The podcast landscape has evolved significantly in the past few years, particularly with the rise of video-forward, creator-led content,” Amazon said in an emailed statement.“These changes reflect that evolution and will streamline how Wondery integrates further into Amazon. By making these changes, we can better support creators in monetizing their content across multiple channels, help them expand their brand IP, and simplify the process for advertisers while making content more accessible to audiences wherever they prefer to consume it. This evolution builds on Wondery’s early success with video-forward shows and positions us to better serve creators, customers, and advertisers.”Despite securing big names in the business, the company is now shifting its strategy in an effort to better compete with rivals like Spotify and YouTube as the podcasting industry embraces video formats.Update: The article was updated to reflect that Amazon denied reports of Wondery shutting down.Techcrunch eventTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agendaNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

The evidence is everywhere: It’s on your refrigerator door, where you’ve hung up the wedding invitations of friends who met on Tinder. It’s on your Instagram feed, where a friend shares a sappy post about her one-year anniversary with a woman she met on Hinge.But when Zeke Rothfels tells people that she met her husband online, she’s not talking about swiping left until she finally found the right guy. She’s talking about cultivating a relationship across the U.S.-Canada border with a man she met in a Facebook meme group.“I think we both felt kind of like, is this crazy?” Rothfels told TechCrunch. “Do I acknowledge that this feels like something, or will that ruin it?”It was crazy, but it was also real — six years later, Rothfels is reminiscing about meeting her husband after she’s just put their 2-year-old child to sleep.“Do I acknowledge that this feels like something, or will that ruin it?”Everyone is tired of dating apps. This massdisillusionmenthas sent the stocks of dating giantstumbling. The stock prices of Bumble and Match Group — the company behind 45 dating apps, including Tinder, Hinge, and OkCupid — have declined about90%and68%over the last five years, respectively. Together, these companies have shed$40 billionin market cap since 2021, struggling to capture the attention of Gen Z users.But the internet’s presence in our social lives won’t just disappear. As singlesgrow wearyof swiping, couples are getting to know each other on traditional social media sites — in the Tumblr “Ask” box, in Reddit DMs, and even onnewer platforms like Bluesky.People may not turn to social media with the intent to find love, but these online spaces naturally forge connections, and sometimes, those connections grow beyond friendship. Here, people are no longer at the mercy of dating apps’ mysterious algorithms and emphasis on physical appearance, nor do they have to face an inexplicable number offish photos. It makes these unexpected digital “meet-cutes” look more appealing than updating your Tinder profile again.Swipe fatigueImage Credits:Pew Research CenterBy 2013, online dating had become the most popular way for heterosexual couples in America to meet, according to the longstanding “How Couples Meet and Stay Together” study from Stanford. By 2019, about 40% of heterosexual couples hadmet online, doubling the number of couples who met through friends.Today, about 30% of all American adults have used dating apps, a figure thatincreasesto 52% among never-married adults.With broader adoption, however, people were exposed to the darker sides of dating online. Seven out of 10 online daters said it’s common toencounter people lyingon their profiles, and 66% of women ages 18 to 49 reported being harassed,according to Pew Research. Another 56% said they were sent sexually explicit images they didn’t ask for.Over time, people began to feel that their experiences on dating apps had become more frustrating than hopeful, and the future of the dating app giants was called into question.Meanwhile, discouraged dating app users have begun to create online whisper networks where they can discover if others have had negative experiences with their date. The trend started on “Are we dating the same guy?”-styleFacebook Groups, where women would post screenshots of potential dates’ profiles to find out if they were already seeing someone else.Image Credits:Screenshot of Facebook by TechCrunchThe same concept also powers the newly viral dating advice appTea, which claims to have 1.6 million users. Its sudden popularity has fueled online debate, where men accuse women of doxxing them, and women point to the necessity of sharing these warnings with others. After all, dating apps largely ignored serious safety concerns, like background checks, according to a 2019investigative report byProPublicaand Columbia Journalism Investigations, which highlighted the presence of sexual predators on Match-owned dating apps.Yet the solutions are often as bad as the problems they try to fix. Tea, for example, has seen its security breached twice, withusers’ selfies, private messages, and government IDs shared to 4chan, a notorious web forum.It’s not surprising, then, that some are giving up online dating altogether.The new “meeting online”Rothfels didn’t mean to fall in love with a guy from a Facebook meme group who lived in another country. The internet had other plans.“I always thought he was hot,” Rothfels concedes. “I liked his mustache.”Theseabsurdist communities, mostly populated with quick-witted, offbeat college students, often had thousands of members. Rothfels and her husband, Owen, had only interacted in passing, but she knew that they had similar senses of humor and political views — otherwise, they wouldn’t have both spent so much time in these online spaces.Owen lived in Minneapolis, and she lived in Toronto, so she never acted on her idle crush.

    "full_content": "Researchers at security giant CrowdStrike say they have seen hundreds of cases where North Koreans posing as remote IT workers have infiltrated companies to generate money for the regime, marking a sharp increase over previous years.PerCrowdStrike’s latest threat-hunting report, the company has identified more than 320 incidents over the past 12 months, up by 220% from the year earlier, in which North Koreans gained fraudulent employment at Western companies working remotely as developers.The scheme relies on North Koreans using false identities, resumes, and work histories to gain employment and earn money for the regime, as well as allowing access for the workers to steal data from the companies they work for and later extort them. The aim is to generate funds for North Korea’s sanctioned nuclear weapons program, which has so far madebillions of dollars for the regimeto date.It’s not known exactly how many North Korean IT workers are currently working for unknowing U.S. companies, but some have estimated the number to be in the thousands.According to CrowdStrike, the North Korean IT workers, which the company calls “Famous Chollima” using its naming scheme of hacking groups, rely on generative AI and other AI-powered tools to draft resumes and modify or “deepfake” their appearance during remote interviews.Whilethe scheme is not new, North Koreans are increasingly succeeding at getting jobs, despite sanctions preventing U.S. companies from hiring North Korean workers.CrowdStrike said in its report that one of the ways to prevent hiring sanctioned workers is by implementing better identity verification processes during the hiring phase. TechCrunch has anecdotally heard of some crypto-focused companies asking prospective employees to say critical things about North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong Un, in an effort to weed out potential spies. The would-be North Korean employees are often highly monitored and surveilled, making any such request impossible and likely outing the fraudulent worker.Over the past year, the U.S. Department of Justice has sought to disrupt these operations by going after the U.S.-based facilitators who helprun and operate the schemefor their North Korean bosses. These operations have includedtargeting the individuals who run “laptop farm” operations, which include racks of open laptops used by the North Koreans to remotely do their work as if they were physically located in the United States.Prosecutors saidin a June indictmentthat one North Korean operation stole the identities of 80 individuals in the U.S. between 2021 and 2024 to get remote work at more than 100 U.S. companies."

But the simple fact that Big Sleep found these vulnerabilities is significant, as it shows these tools are starting to get real results, even if there was a human involved in this case.“To ensure high quality and actionable reports, we have a human expert in the loop before reporting, but each vulnerability was found and reproduced by the AI agent without human intervention,” Google’s spokesperson Kimberly Samra told TechCrunch.Royal Hansen, Google’s vice president of engineering,wrote on Xthat the findings demonstrate “a new frontier in automated vulnerability discovery.”LLM-powered tools that can look for and find vulnerabilitiesare already a reality.

It’s important to note that in most cases, these reports have a human at some point of the process to verify that the AI-powered bug hunter found a legitimate vulnerability, as is the case with Big Sleep.Vlad Ionescu, co-founder and chief technology officer at RunSybil, a startup that develops AI-powered bug hunters, told TechCrunch that Big Sleep is a “legit” project, given that it has “good design, people behind it know what they’re doing, Project Zero has the bug finding experience and DeepMind has the firepower and tokens to throw at it.”There is obviously a lot of promise with these tools, but also significant downsides. Several people who maintain different software projects have complained ofbug reports that are actually hallucinations, with some calling them the bug bounty equivalent of AI slop.“That’s the problem people are running into, is we’re getting a lot of stuff that looks like gold, but it’s actually just crap,” Ionescu previously told TechCrunch."

Murray, a commercial model herself, said it made her feel sad and exhausted.The iconic denim company had teamed up with the AI studio Lalaland.ai to create “diverse” digital fashion models for more inclusive ads. For an industry that has failed for years to employ diverse human models, the backlash was swift, with New York Magazine calling the decision “artificial diversity.”“Modeling as a profession is already challenging enough without having to compete with now new digital standards of perfection that can be achieved with AI,” Murray told TechCrunch.Two years later, her worries have compounded. Brands continue to experiment with AI-generated models, to the consternation of many fashion lovers. The latest uproar came after Vogue’s July print edition featured a Guess ad with a typical model for the brand: thin yet voluptuous, glossy blond tresses, pouty rose lips. She exemplified North American beauty standards, but there was one problem — she was AI generated.The internet buzzed for days, in large part because the AI-generated beauty showed up in Vogue, the fashion bible that dictates what is and is not acceptable in the industry. The AI-generated model was featured in an advertisement,nota Vogue editorial spread. And Vogue told TechCrunch the ad met its advertising standards.To many, an ad versus an editorial is a distinction without a difference.TechCrunch spoke to fashion models, experts, and technologists to get a sense of where the industry is headed now that Vogue seems to have put a stamp of approval on technology that’s poised to dramatically change the fashion industry.Techcrunch eventTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agendaNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

And in the world of fashion, what happens to the humans — the models, photographers, stylists, and set designers — performing those jobs?“It’s just so much cheaper”Sinead Bovell, a model and founder of theWAYEorganization whowrote about CGI models for Voguefive years ago, told TechCrunch that “e-commerce models” are most under threat of automation.E-commerce models are the ones who pose for advertisements or display clothes and accessories for online shoppers. Compared to high-fashion models, whose striking, often unattainable looks are featured in editorial spreads and on runways, they’re more realistic and relatable.“E-commerce is where most models make their bread and butter,” Bovell said. “It’s not necessarily the path to model fame or model prestige, but it is the path for financial security.”sinead bovell, founder and model.Image Credits:Sinead BovellThat fact is running in direct contrast to the pressure many brands feel to automate such shoots. Paul Mouginot, an art technologist who has worked with luxury brands, said it’s simply expensive to work with live models, especially when it comes to photographing them in countless garments, shoes, and accessories.“AI now lets you start with a flat-lay product shoot, place it on a photorealistic virtual model, and even position that model in a coherent setting, producing images that look like genuine fashion editorials,” he told TechCrunch.Brands, in some ways, have been doing this for a while, he said. Mouginot, who is French, cited the French retailer Veepee as an example of a company that has used virtual mannequins to sell clothes since at least 2013. Other notable brands likeH&M,Mango, and Calvin Klein have also resorted to AI models.Amy Odell,a fashion writerand author of a recently publishedbiography onGwyneth Paltrow, put it more simply: “It’s just so much cheaper for [brands] to use AI models now. Brands need a lot of content, and it just adds up. So if they can save money on their print ad or their TikTok feed, they will.”PJ Pereira, co-founder of AI ad firmSilverside AI, said it really comes down to scal"

    "full_content": "OpenAI announced Tuesday the launch of Study Mode, a new feature within ChatGPT that aims to help students develop their own critical thinking skills, rather than simply obtain answers to questions. With Study Mode enabled, ChatGPT will ask users questions to test their understanding and, in some cases, refuse to offer direct answers unless students engage with the material.OpenAI says Study Mode is rolling out to logged in users on ChatGPT’s Free, Plus, Pro, and Team plans starting Tuesday. The company expects to introduce Study Mode to its Edu subscribers, which largely consists of young people whose school administrator’s have purchased a plan for the entire student body, in the coming weeks.Study Mode is OpenAI’s attempt to addressthe millions of students who use ChatGPT in school. Studies have shown that usingChatGPT can be a helpful tutorfor young people, but it alsomay harm their critical thinking skills.A research paper released in June found thatpeople who use ChatGPT to write essays exhibit lower brain activity during the processcompared to those who use Google Search or nothing at all.When ChatGPT first launched in 2022, its widespread use in school settings sparked fear among educators, leading to generative AI bans in many American school districts. By 2023,some of those schools repealed their ChatGPT bans, and teachers around the country came to terms with the fact that ChatGPT would be a part of young people’s lives from now on.Now with the launch of Study Mode, OpenAI hopes to improve ChatGPT as a learning tool, and not just an answer engine. Anthropic launched a similar tool for its AI chatbot Claude,called Learning Mode, in April.Of course, there are limitations to how effective Study Mode truly is. Students can easily switch into the regular mode of ChatGPT if they just want an answer to a question. OpenAI’s VP of Education, Leah Belsky, told TechCrunch in a briefing that the company is not offering tools for parents or administrators to lock students into Study Mode. However, Belsky said OpenAI may explore administrative or parental controls in the future.That means it will take a committed student to use Study Mode — the kids have to really want to learn, not just finish their assignment.Techcrunch eventTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agendaNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Starting in September 2024, Dribbble began pivoting to a marketplace that connected designers and clients. Designers could communicate freely on the platform and then either share a 3.5% revenue cut on clients they converted, or they could pay fora Pro subscriptionto skip the rev share. In March, the company tightened the rules further, saying that anyone finding clients on Dribbble would need to offer the platform a cut of their revenue.“It went from it was optional to use our transactional features to it was required for non-advertisers to use our transactional features, if they were on Dribbble, to find clients,” explainsDribbble CEOConstantine Anastasakis, in an interview with TechCrunch. “If a user is on Dribbble to find inspiration or to get feedback on their work, or to talk shop with their peers, none of this affects them,” he added.Image Credits:DribbbleThe exec, who joined the company after working at direct-to-consumer lender Lower, video marketplace Pond5 (exited to Shutterstock), and freelancer marketplace Fiverr, was hired last April to pivot Dribbble into a marketplace.

Matt Dewine, a spokesperson for Foxconn, declined to say more about the buyer.Foxconn sold the factory and land for around $88 million and machinery and equipment from its EV subsidiaries for around $287 million, Taiwan stock exchange filings show.A Foxconn representative toldAutomotive Newsthe company will remain “involved in the manufacturing of products for customers at the Lordstown facility” and claimed it is “committed to customers and suppliers” in the automotive industry. But The Wall Street Journalreported Mondaythat Foxconn now plans to build AI servers at the factory. Dewine did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report.Foxconn announced the deal to buy the former GM plant in 2021 for $230 million, when it was still owned by EV startup Lordstown Motors. At the time, Foxconn Chairman Young Liu said it was going to be the “most important electric vehicle manufacturing and R&D hub in North America.”While Foxconn was developing EVs of its own in Asia, it was also focused on contract manufacturing in the United States.

But the Taiwanese electronics giant wound up in a bitter fight with that troubled EV startup. Lordstown Motors filed for bankruptcy in June 2023, and accused Foxconn — which had become an investor in the startup — of “starving it of cash,” and said it “maliciously and in bad faith destroyed that business.”Foxconn also took a flier on a small EV startup called IndiEV, claiming it would build its electric SUV at the Ohio factory. IndiEV filed for bankruptcy inOctober 2023with less than $3 million in the bank. Foxconn was supposed tobuild EVs for Fisker Inc.as well. Fiskerfiled for bankruptcy in June 2024.A fourth company, Monarch Tractor, hasnot had much of an impact, with Foxconn making no more than a few hundred electric tractors. Monarch’s CEO, Praveen Penmetsa, did not respond to an emailed request for comment about whether its tractors will continue to be built in Ohio."

But just as Grok’s unrestrained nature was entertaining until it started spewing hateful, antisemitic, misogynistic content, Grok Imagine could be poised to bring its own set of unintended consequences.CNBC first reportedthe existence of a “spicy mode” last week after xAI employee Mati Roy said in a now-deleted post on X: “Grok Imagine videos have a spicy mode that cando nudity.”TechCrunch has reached out to xAI for more information.The existing limitations with Grok Imagine are somewhat heartening given the model also lets you create content of celebrities — anyone from Donald Trump to Taylor Swift — and there appear to be additional restrictions on those. For example, TechCrunch tried, and failed, to generate an image of Trump pregnant. Grok Imagine only generated images of Trump holding a baby or next to a pregnant woman.While it’s still early days for Grok Imagine, which aims to compete with incumbents like Google DeepMind, OpenAI, Runway, and Chinese rivals, the images and videos generated of humans are still a bit lost in the uncanny valley, with waxy-looking skin that verges on cartoonish at times.Techcrunch eventTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agendaNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

This has happened while Tesla’ssales growth has vanishedand its brand has been damaged by Musk’s involvement in the Trump administration.TeslasaidMonday that its board of directors formed a special committee earlier this year consisting of chairwoman Robyn Denholm and board member Kathleen Wilson-Thompson in order to sort out a new package.The award they ultimately decided on involves giving Musk 96 million shares that will vest in two years, provided that he “serve continuously in a senior leadership role at Tesla” during that term and holds the stock for five years. Unlike Tesla’s previous award to Musk, this new package does not appear to be tied to goals like increasing the company’s stock price.Techcrunch eventTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agendaNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Musk will have to pay a $23.34-per-share purchase price, bringing the total current value of the award to him to roughly $26.7 billion. Depending on how the Delaware Supreme Court rules on Tesla’s appeal, the package may be forfeited so “there cannot be any ‘double dip,’ according to Tesla.“Elon will not be able to keep this new award in addition to the options he will be awarded under the 2018 CEO Performance Award should the courts rule in our favor,” the company wrote.Tesla said Musk and his brother Kimbal, who is also a board member, recused themselves from the process of constructing this new compensation package. Musk’s involvement in the 2018 compensation package was one of the reasons Delaware Chancery Court Judge Chancellor Kathaleen McCormickdecided to strike it downfollowing a trial sparked by a shareholder lawsuit.McCormick said the process of creating that 2018 plan was “deeply flawed” because of Musk’s input and his deep connections to the people on Tesla’s board. She also criticized that plan for not including any terms that would bind Musk to Tesla for “any set amount of time” — a likely reason for the two-year pledge included in the new plan.McCormick’s decision caused an uproar among Tesla’s largest fans and many of its shareholders. It’s also what inspired the company to re-incorporate from Delaware to Texas, a state with fewer established shareholder protections written into its laws. Tesla went as far as holding a shareholder vote to “re-affirm” the pay package. But McCormickconfirmed her decision in December 2024, saying the vote and Tesla’s legal arguments were “unprecedented theories [that] go against multiple strains of settled law.”Update: This story and the headline have been updated to reflect that the award has been approved by Tesla’s board and does not need a shareholder vote."

While Adobe cited the lack of a “clear path” to approval from the European Commission and the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority, the acquisition also faced regulatory scrutiny in the United States over concerns that it could prevent Figma from being an “effective competitor” to Adobe.Khan was FTC chair at the time, leading the agency to challenge Big Tech on fronts such as startup acquisitions — to the point that companies tried to avoid this scrutiny with “reverse acqui-hires” in which they hired key team members and licensed technology rather than acquiring startups outright. (The practiceseems to be continuingdespite Khan’s departure from the FTC.)While her aggressive stance led to intense criticism from corners of the tech industry,she defended her approachby saying that only a tiny percentage of deals received “a second look” and arguing that founders would ultimately benefit from “a world in which you have six or seven or eight potential suitors” rather than “just one or two.”And although Khan — who’d been appointed by President Joe Biden —resigned at the startof the second Trump administration, her comments Friday paint the Figma IPO as a vindication for her approach, calling the IPO “a win for employees, investors, innovation, and the public.”Of course, Khan’s critics are more likely to see Figma’s success as coming despite regulatory scrutiny, not because of it. For example, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ivestold Business Insider, “Figma is a massive success, but it’s because of the company’s innovative growth and not due to the FTC and [Khan].”Techcrunch eventTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agendaNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Sign up here for free — just clickTechCrunch Mobility!Tesla CEOElon Muskis in what one might describe a suboptimal position. He’s pushed hard to get shareholders to view Tesla as an AI and robotics company, not a maker of EVs. And yet, the company’s most visible products, which generate the bulk of its revenues, are its electric cars.Yes, Tesla EVs are advanced, particularly when it comes to its underlying vehicle architecture and software. And its driver-assistance system known as Full Self-Driving Supervised, which can be used on highways and city streets and requires hands on the wheel and the driver to be ready to take over, is considered among the most capable on the market today. But to Musk, the ultimate illustration of an AI and robotics company is self-driving cars and humanoid robots. And today, neither of them exist at any scale.Tesla’s first notable step toward that goal was in June when it launched a limited robotaxi service in Austin, Texas. Those Robotaxi-branded vehicles, which invited customers can hail via an app, have a Tesla employee sitting in the front passenger seat. But it’s still far from Musk’s original vision of a “general solution” that would allow a Tesla owner to earn money by renting out their vehicle as a robotaxi service.The clock is ticking and Musk needs to show more progress — or at the very least tease upcoming launches to keep antsy shareholders content. Which is perhaps why Tesla is embarking on this ride-hailing gambit in California.Earlier this month, Musk noted that Tesla would be launching a robotaxi service in the Bay Area“in a month or two”— regulatory approvals being the primary hang-up.The problem? Tesla hasn’t even applied for the permits that would allow it to operate a robotaxi service. I checked Friday morning with the California DMV, which regulates driverless testing, and Tesla has not yet applied for the necessary permits. (A spokesperson did tell me the DMV met with Tesla to discuss the company’s plans to test autonomous vehicles in the state.)Techcrunch eventTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agendaNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

And yeah, users keep calling these robotaxis.To be clear, while folks — including Musk’s brother and Tesla board member Kimbal Musk —may refer to these as robotaxis, they are not driving autonomously. (And if they are, it would be a violation of current regulations.) Again, Tesla does not currently have the permits to do anything beyond pay its own employees to use its fleet of EVs to drive people around the Bay Area. No autonomous driving in any way, shape, or form. You can read arecent explainer herethat will take you through all of the various permits Tesla needs.This ride-hailing launch has many folks wondering, what gives?

Silicon Valley-based OpenMind is focused under the hood.OpenMindis building a software layer, OM1, for humanoid robots that acts as an operating system. The company compares itself to being the Android for robotics because its software is open and hardware agnostic.Stanford professor Jan Liphardt, the founder of OpenMind, told TechCrunch that humanoids and other robots have been around and able to do repetitive tasks for decades. But now that humanoids are being developed for use cases that require more human-to-machine interactions, like having a humanoid in your home, they need a new operating system that thinks more like a human.“All of a sudden, this world is opening where machines are able to interact with humans in ways I’ve certainly never before seen,” Liphardt said. “We’re very much believers here that it’s not just about the humans, but we really think of ourselves as a company that is a collaboration between machines and humans.”OpenMind unveiled on Monday a new protocol called FABRIC that allows robots to verify identity and share context and information with other robots.Unlike humans, machines can learn almost instantly, Liphardt said, which means giving them a better way to connect to other robots will allow them to more easily train and absorb new information.Liphardt gave the example of languages and how robots could connect to each other and share data on how to speak different languages, which would help them better interact with more people without having to be taught each language by a human directly.Techcrunch eventTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agendaNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Machines, of course, are going to be no different.”OpenMind was founded in 2024 and is gearing up to ship its first fleet of 10 OM1-powered robotic dogs by September. Liphardt said that he’s a big believer in getting the tech out there and iterating on it after the fact.“We full well expect all the humans that will be hosting these quadrupeds, they’ll come back with a long list of things they didn’t like or they want, and then it’s up to us to very, very quickly iterate and improve the machines,” he said.The company also recently raised a $20 million funding round led by Pantera Capital, with participation from Ribbit, Coinbase Ventures, and Pebblebed, among other strategic investors and angel investors.Now, the company is focused on getting its tech into people’s homes and starting to iterate on the product.“The most important thing for us is to get robots out there and to get feedback,” Liphardt said. “Our goal as a company is to do as many of these tests as we can, so that we can very rapidly identify the most interesting opportunities where the capabilities of the robots today are optimally matched against what humans are looking for.”"

We contribute to hundreds of groups from across the political spectrum that advocate for pro-innovation policies, and those groups change from year to year based on where our contributions will have the most impact.”The discovery of the changes comes after the Trump administration said it would target companies openly showing support for DEI. CNBC points out it’s unclear if Google is secretly still supporting these groups, however.This past year, Google said itwould no longer have diversity hiring goals, after it removed language referring to“underrepresented” groupsfrom its grant website andremoved mention of “diversity” and “equity”from its responsible AI web page; it also removed mention of DEI fromits 10-K filings this year.The groups dropped from Google’s funding list had mission statements using words like “race” and “women,” terms the Trump administration instructed federal agencies to dial back on using, the report said.This piece was updated to add a response from Google’s spokesperson."

But access to that capital is harder than ever,” she said.Gao, who spoke at TechCrunch’s All Stage conference in July, said it’s possible for startup founders, especially those in the later Series C stage, to navigate this particular economic environment. And they need to start with a reality check.To begin, she said, it’s important to note that only one in five startups that raise a Series A ever make it to raise a Series C. And, in the past year, the bar for raising late-stage capital has only risen; investors are no longer just chasing momentum, as many were in the last few years — they are chasingcertainty, Gao said.“Investors are now asking: ‘Is this company truly a winner in whatever market that they’re serving?’” Gao said. “The question really isn’t, ‘Is this company growing?’ The question has shifted to, ‘Is this company on a trajectory where the upside is really undeniable?’”Companies raising Series C rounds should meet certain criteria. For one, they’re all category leaders, according to Gao.“They’re defining their categories. They have clear go-to-market and undeniable pull,” she said. “In short, they’re growing efficiently, but there’s also traction to show that these are truly the market leaders in the spaces that they operate in.”Companies looking to raise a Series C should also remember that metrics do not always equal money. Sure, metrics are important, as are annual returns, growth, and retention, she said, but if investors are not sold on the idea that a company can truly become a leader in their respective space, then they are going to move on.Techcrunch eventTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agendaNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

For example, there are companies that don’t have amazing metrics yet somehow raise a suitable Series C round. In one case, a startup nabbed more than a $2 billion valuation, she noted. “They were effectively able to communicate the story to investors why this company will be a leading company over time,” Gao said of the company’s successful raise.Another Gao rule: Continuity is better than short-term virility.In the age of AI, companies are growing faster than investors have ever seen before, she noted. “But oftentimes it’s the case, what goes up also sharply comes down,” Gao said. “So the question is, ‘Is this growth sustainable?’”In a Series C, investors are looking for “compounding loops,” or seeing that the company gets stronger as it scales, she said.“Does your product get better for every new customer you sign? Does your CAC [customer acquisition cost] decrease or increase for every new user you bring on board?” she asked.If the answer is yes, then investors will “lean in,” Gao said; if the answer is no, then investors are most likely to “lean out,” even if a company’s metrics look very strong.Finally, she said, founders should treat fundraising like a go-to-market campaign and seek to develop relationships with VCs before pitching them for capital. Gao cited her firm as an example. Sapphire likes to invest in a company at the Series B level, but they usually have known the company for a year or longer.“That means at the Series A, even though we’re not actively leaning in to try and raise, we’re trying to build a relationship with a company and with the founder,” she said. “We’re getting information and we’re developing a longitudinal picture of how this company has progressed.”She said founders should start building a “lightweight investor CRM,” or a database managing the relationships with investors.Investors take notes while meeting with founders, and founders should do the same, she said. Founders should write down the names of partners, what they like to invest in, and what companies they’ve backed recently. Create a distribution list and send out periodic updates to the investors on it, she said. “This is an easy way to keep inventors in the loop.”Perhaps most importantly, however, Gao noted that a company looking to raise a Serie"

    "full_content": "Even while the tech industry is still fanning its face over Figma’s hot IPO on Thursday, another significant tech IPO occurred this week:Ambiq Micro.On Wednesday, the chip maker for wearable devices saw its shares climb from the initial price of $24 to over $42 on Friday.There’s one thing both companies have in common: Kleiner Perkins was a major investor.So it’s been a very good week for the venerable venture firm. Just for fun, we’ve calculated the value of Kleiner Perkins’ stake in each company.Kleiner sold 1,346,499 shares of Figma at the IPO price of $33,Figma disclosed, and could have sold as many as 2,756,020 shares at that price if the bankers exercised their option to nab additional shares. Given how muchdemand outstripped supply for shares of Figma, we’re going to assume the bankers will snap up the full tranche (or they already have).Meanwhile, Kleiner still holds 52,364,374 shares of Figma, the company says. Share prices are still fluctuating wildly in heavy trading on Day 2, from about $110 to over $142, but closed Day 1 at $115, so we’ll use that number.For Figma: An estimated $91 million returned from share sales and a remaining stake worth more than $6 billion (2,756,02 shares at $33 = $90,948,660, and 52,364,374 shares at $115 = $6,021,903,010).For perspective, this stake in Figma alone is worth 3x the last mega-funds the firm raised, which was$2 billion across two vehicles in 2024. By the way, the Kleiner partner who oversaw its investment was Figma board member Mamoon Hamid.Techcrunch eventTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agendaNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

It sold a total of 4 million shares and raised $96 million for itself in its IPO. Existing shareholders are subject to the classic 180 days lockup before they can sell. Kleiner holds 2,081,831 shares,the company disclosed. Shares are still trading at a premium to the IPO price as of Friday and closed Thursday at $43.85. So we’ll use that price.Ambiq stake: $91.3 million (2,081,831 at $43.85 = $91,288,289).But wait! There’s more. Kleiner is also having a good month and possibly year (Kleiner has declined comment for this story).The firm reportedly scored a decent return earlier this month as part ofGoogle’s deal to license tech from Windsurfand hire away its top talent. We don’t know exactly howmuch of the $1.1 billion or so VCs obtainedfrom the Windsurf deal went to Kleiner specifically. But TechCrunch’s Marina Temkin reports the total return was about 3x the original funding.And at least one more Kleiner-backed company is waiting in the wings to IPO. Fleet tracking startup Motive Technologies raised $150 million led by Kleiner Perkins, with Ilya Fushman joining the board, the companyannouncedthis week. Bloombergreportedin December that Motive is gearing up for an IPO, potentially still in 2025."

    "full_content": "Lovense, a maker of internet-connected sex toys, has confirmed it hasfixed a pair of security vulnerabilitiesthat exposed users’ private email addresses and allowed attackers to remotely take over any user’s account.While the company said the bugs were “fully resolved,” its chief executive is now considering taking legal action following the disclosure.Ina statementshared with TechCrunch, Lovense CEO Dan Liu said the sex toy maker was “investigating the possibility of legal action” in response to allegedly erroneous reports about the bug. When asked by TechCrunch, the company did not respond to clarify whether it was referring to media reports or to a security researcher’s disclosure.Details of the bug emerged this week after a security researcher, who goes by the handle BobDaHacker, disclosed that theyreported the two security bugsto the sex toy maker earlier this year. The researcher published their findings after Lovense claimed it would take 14 months to fully address the vulnerabilities rather than applying a “faster, one-month fix” that would have required alerting users to update their apps.Lovense said in its statement, attributed to Liu, that the fixes put in place will require users to update their apps before they can resume using all of the app’s features.In the statement, Liu claimed that there is “no evidence suggesting that any user data, including email addresses or account information, has been compromised or misused.” It’s not clear how Lovense came to this conclusion, given TechCrunch (and other outlets) verified the email disclosure bug by setting up a new account and asking the researcher to identify the associated email address.TechCrunch asked Lovense what technical means, such as logs, the company has to determine if there was any compromise of users’ data, but a spokesperson did not respond.It’s not unheard of for organizations to resort to legal demands and threats to try to block the disclosure of embarrassing security incidents, despite few rules or restrictions in the U.S. prohibiting such reporting.Earlier this year, a U.S. independent journalistrebuffed a legal threatfrom a U.K. court injunction for accurately reporting a ransomware attack on U.K. private healthcare giant HCRG. In 2023, a county official in Hillsborough County, Florida,threatened criminal charges against a security researcherunder the state’s computer hacking laws for identifying and privately disclosing a security flaw in the county’s court records system that exposed access to sensitive filings."

The company says this was a short-lived experiment that ultimately “introduced too many opportunities for folks to accidentally share things they didn’t intend to.” The original story follows.It’s a strange glimpse into the human mind: If youfilter search resultson Google, Bing, and other search engines to only include URLs from the domain “https://chatgpt.com/share,” you can find strangers’ conversations with ChatGPT.Sometimes, these shared conversation links are pretty dull — people ask for helprenovating their bathroom, understandingastrophysics, and findingrecipe ideas.In another case, one user asks ChatGPT to rewrite their resume for a particular job application (judging by this person’s LinkedIn, which was easy to find based on the details in the chat log, they did not get the job). Someone else is asking questions that sound like they came out of an incel forum. Another person asks the snarky, hostile AI assistant if they canmicrowave a metal fork(for the record: no), but they continue to ask the AI increasingly absurd and trollish questions, eventually leading it to create a guide called “How to Use a Microwave Without Summoning Satan: A Beginner’s Guide.”ChatGPT does not make these conversations public by default.A conversation would be appended with a “/share” URL only if the user deliberately clicks the “share” button on their own chat and then clicks a second “create link” button. The service also declares that “your name, custom instructions, and any messages you add after sharing stay private.” After clicking through to create a link, users can toggle whether or not they want that link to be discoverable.However, users may not anticipate that other search engines will index their shared ChatGPT links, potentially betraying personal information (my apologies to the person whose LinkedIn I discovered).Techcrunch eventTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agendaNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

When people share public links to files from Google Drive, such as documents with the “Anyone with link can view” setting, Google may index them in Search. However, Google generally does not surface links to Drive documents that have not been publicly posted on the web — for example, a document may appear in search if it is linked on a trusted website.According to ChatGPT, these chats were indexed as part of an experiment.“ChatGPT chats are not public unless you choose to share them,” an OpenAI spokesperson told TechCrunch. “We’ve been testing ways to make it easier to share helpful conversations, while keeping users in control, and we recently ended an experiment to have chats appear in search engine results if you explicitly opted in when sharing.”While search engines like Google control the algorithms that determine what content gets surface for search terms, the search engines themselves cannot control what gets indexed.“Neither Google nor any other search engine controls what pages are made public on the web,” a Google spokesperson told TechCrunch. “Publishers of these pages have full control over whether they are indexed by search engines.”Updated, 7/31/25, 5:30 pm ET with comment and additional context from OpenAI."

OpenAI initially raised $2.5 billion from VC firms in March when it announced its intention to raise $40 billion in a round spearheaded by SoftBank. The AI giant had planned to take on an additional $7.5 billion by the end of the year, but beat itself to the punch as investors clamber to get onto its cap table amid impressive growth.On Thursday,The Informationreported OpenAI hit $12 billion in annualized revenue and surpassed 700 million ChatGPT weekly active users. The Times today said that the number is closer to $13 billion, with projections to reach $20 billion by the end of the year. Other tailwinds include theTrump administration’s AI Action Planandtalks with Microsoftthat could help the startup reach its goal of becoming a true for-profit company.The Times reported that Dragoneer Investment Group, an under-the-radar investor, led the round with a startling $2.8 billion check.

Rivian is currently able to sell EVs directly to consumers in 25 states and in Washington, D.C.Ohio’s BMV did not immediately respond to a request for comment.“Ohio’s prohibition of Rivian’s direct-sales-only business model is irrational in the extreme: it reduces competition, decreases consumer choice, and drives up consumer costs and inconvenience — all of which harm consumers — with literally no countervailing benefit,” lawyers for the company wrote in the complaint.Rivian is asking the court to allow the company to apply for a dealership license so it can sell vehicles directly. Ohio customers have to buy from Rivian vehicles from locations in other states where direct sales are allowed. The cars are then shipped to Rivian service centers within Ohio.Allowing Rivian to sell directly would not be treading new legal ground, the company argues in its complaint. Tesla has had a license to sell in Ohio since 2013 and can sell directly to consumers.What’s stopping Rivian is a 2014 law passed by the state’s legislature. That law, which Rivian says came after an intense lobbying effort by the Ohio Automobile Dealers Association (OADA), effectively gave Tesla a carve-out and blocked any future manufacturers from acquiring the necessary dealership licenses. (The OADA did not immediately return a request for comment.)Techcrunch eventTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agendaNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Ohio’s archaic prohibition against the direct-sales of vehicles is unconstitutional, irrational, and harms Ohioans by reducing competition and choice and driving up costs and inconvenience,” Mike Callahan, Rivian’s chief administrative officer, said in a statement.Rivian has won legal fights over direct sales before. In 2021, Rivian and Lucid Motors were granted dealership licenses to sell EVs in Illinois. That state’s dealer association sued to try to block Rivian and Lucid from selling directly butultimately failed.Lucid Motors, meanwhile,filed a lawsuit of its own in Texas in 2022in a challenge to that state’s direct-sales ban. The court ruled against Lucid earlier this year, but the company has appealed, federal court records show."

    "full_content": "Lyft’s European expansion will include Chinese-made robotaxis.The U.S. ride-hailing company announced Monday it has made a strategic partnership with Baidu to deploy the Chinese tech giant’s Apollo Go autonomous vehicles across several European markets. The companies want to launch robotaxi services in Germany and the United Kingdom in 2026, pending regulatory approval.If approved, Baidu’s RT6 vehicles, which are equipped with its Apollo Go self-driving system, will be integrated into Lyft’s ride-hailing app. Lyft CEO David Risher said the robotaxi service is an example of its “hybrid network approach, where AVs and human drivers work together to provide customer-obsessed options for riders.”Lyft has historically centered its ride-hailing business on the United States, while rival Uber has expanded globally and into other areas, like food delivery. But earlier this year, Lyft bought its way into the European market when it agreed to acquire the German multi-mobility app FREENOW from BMW and Mercedes-Benz Mobility forabout $197 million in cash.The acquisition opened the European market to Lyft, which has only operated in the U.S. and Canada since it launched in 2012.Lyft and Uber, both of which sunsetted their own internal autonomous vehicle programs, are in a race to lock up partnerships with companies like Baidu, which have developed the technology.Uber has partnered with more than 18 companies, covering the spectrum of how self-driving systems can be applied to the physical world, includingride-hailing, delivery, and trucking. In this year alone, it has announced deals with Ann Arbor, Michigan-based May Mobility andVolkswagen, as well as Chinese self-driving firms Momenta,WeRide, and Baidu. Last month, Uber investedhundreds of millions of dollarsinto EV maker Lucid and autonomous vehicle technology startup Nuro in a bid to launch its own premium robotaxi service.Lyft hasn’t had the same pace of deals as Uber, but has made a few partnerships in the past year, including a plan toadd autonomous shuttlesmade by Austrian manufacturer Benteler Group to its network in late 2026. Lyft has also said it plans to putAVs from May Mobilityon its network in Atlanta later this year.Techcrunch eventTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agendaNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

    "full_content": "The U.S. federal government and cybersecurity researchers say a newly discovered security bug found in Microsoft’s SharePoint is under attack.U.S. cybersecurity agency CISAsounded the alarm this weekendthat hackers were actively exploiting the bug. Microsoft has not yet provided patches for all affected SharePoint versions, leaving customers across the world largely unable to defend against the ongoing intrusions.Microsoft said the bug, known officially asCVE-2025-53770, affects versions of SharePoint that companies set up and manage on their own servers. SharePoint lets companies store, share, and manage their internal files.Microsoft said it is working on security fixes to prevent hackers from exploiting the vulnerability. The flaw, described as a “zero-day” because the vendor was given no time to patch the bug before it was made aware of it, affects versions of the software as old as SharePoint Server 2016.It’s not yet known how many servers have been compromised so far, but it is likely thousands of small to medium-sized businesses that rely on the software are affected. According toThe Washington Post, several U.S. federal agencies, universities, and energy companies have already been breached in the attacks.Eye Security, whichfirst revealed the bugon Saturday, said it found “dozens” of actively exploited Microsoft SharePoint servers online at the time of its publication. The bug, when exploited, allows hackers to steal private digital keys from SharePoint servers without needing any credentials to log in. Once in, the hackers can remotely plant malware and gain access to the files and data stored within. Eye Security warned that SharePoint connects with other apps, like Outlook, Teams, and OneDrive, which may enable further network compromise and data theft.Eye Security said because the bug involves the theft of digital keys that can be used to impersonate legitimate requests on the server, affected customers must both patch the bug and take additional steps to rotate their digital keys to prevent the hackers from recompromising the server.CISA and others have urged customers to “take immediate recommended action.” In the absence of patches or mitigations, customers should consider disconnecting potentially affected systems from the internet.“If you have SharePoint [on-premise] exposed to the internet, you should assume that you have been compromised at this point,” said Michael Sikorski, the head of Palo Alto Networks’ threat intelligence division Unit 42, in an email to TechCrunch.It’s also not yet known who is carrying out the attacks on SharePoint servers, but it is the latest in a string of cyberattacks targeting Microsoft customers in recent years.In 2021, a China-backed hacking group dubbed Hafnium was caught exploiting a vulnerability found in self-hosted Microsoft Exchange email servers, allowingthe mass-hacking and exfiltration of email and contacts data from businessesaround the world. The hackers compromised more than 60,000 servers, according to arecent Justice Department indictmentaccusing two Chinese nationals of masterminding the operation.Two years later, Microsoft confirmed a cyberattack on its cloud systems, which it manages directly, allowing Chinese hackers tosteal a sensitive email signing keythat permitted access to both consumer and enterprise email accounts hosted by the company.Microsoft has also reportedrepeated intrusionsfrom hackers associated with the Russian government.Do you know more about the SharePoint cyberattacks? Are you an affected customer? Securely contact this reporter via encrypted message at zackwhittaker.1337 on Signal.An earlier version of this story stated the incorrect CVE number; the story has been amended to note the correct vulnerability, CVE-2025-53770."

When it raised its seed funding, Fundamental Research Labs was developing bots that could play Minecraft with you.Today, the company has a games team, a prosumer team building apps, a core research team, and a platform team. The startup’s founder, Dr. Robert Yang, a former faculty member at MIT, says that Fundamental Research Labs wants to be a “historical” company without adhering to a typical startup structure.Yang said that the company is already charging users for this agent after a seven-day trial and bringing in revenue.Among the products Fundamental Research Labs offers is a general-purpose consumer assistant calledFairies. This app allows you to chat with an AI bot, connect applications, and ask questions across the knowledge bases of those applications, then ask it to schedule appointments for you on your calendar. The app can schedule workflows for you to repeatedly execute some tasks. Yang said that this app allows the startup’s engineers to test out various capabilities of models and platform tech it is developing.The company also offers a spreadsheet-based agent calledShortcut, which has been used by analysts for creating different financial models and performing analysis over them. The startup said that this agent works like a junior analyst and can do work autonomously. The company has made it look like Excel and has tried to retain a lot of functionality for power users.“We’ve seen many early-stage startups, but what stood out here is a small, highly mission-driven team focused on digital humans with actual use cases. Their recent launches, like Fairies and Shortcut, aren’t just demos; they’re already demonstrating how AI can augment the human workforce in meaningful ways,” Sandeep Bakshi, an investment partner at Prosus, told TechCrunch over email.Techcrunch eventTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agendaNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

These systems spawn multiple AI agents to tackle a question in parallel, a process that uses significantly more computational resources than a single agent, but tends to result in better answers.Google used a variation of Gemini 2.5 Deep Think toscore a gold medalat this year’s International Math Olympiad (IMO).Alongside Gemini 2.5 Deep Think, the company says it is releasing the model it used at the IMO to a select group of mathematicians and academics. Google says this AI model “takes hours to reason,” instead of seconds or minutes like most consumer-facing AI models. The company hopes the IMO model will enhance research efforts, and aims to get feedback on how to improve the multi-agent system for academic use cases.Google notes that the Gemini 2.5 Deep Think model is a significant improvement over what it announced at I/O. The company also claims to have developed “novel reinforcement learning techniques” to encourage Gemini 2.5 Deep Think to make better use of its reasoning paths.“Deep Think can help people tackle problems that require creativity, strategic planning and making improvements step-by-step,” said Google in ablog postshared with TechCrunch.Techcrunch eventTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agendaNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

The company claims the model could aid researchers and “potentially accelerate the path to discovery.”Art scenes made by Google’s AIImage Credits:GoogleIt seems that several leading AI labs are converging around the multi-agent approach.Elon Musk’s xAI recently released a multi-agent system of its own,Grok 4 Heavy, which it says was able to achieve industry-leading performance on several benchmarks. OpenAI researcher Noam Brown said on apodcastthat the unreleased AI model the company used to achieve a gold medal at this year’s International Math Olympiad was also a multi-agent system. Meanwhile,Anthropic’s Research agent, which generates thorough research briefs, is also powered by a multi-agent system.Despite the strong performance, it seems that multi-agent systems are even costlier to serve than traditional AI models. That means tech companies may keep these systems gated behind their most expensive subscription plans, which xAI and now Google have chosen to do.In the coming weeks, Google says it plans to share Gemini 2.5 Deep Think with a select group of testers via the Gemini API.

And while many of the startups garnering large valuations are focused on hardware and weaponry — thinkAnduril,Shield AI, andSkydio—Rune Technologieswants to tackle AI-enabled software for military logistics.“The U.S. military runs on Excel spreadsheets and whiteboards and manual processes right now to execute logistics operations,” co-founder David Tuttle told TechCrunch. “Logistics is never the sexiest part of the military. The technology industry emphasis is on how do we make things go boom? How do we build great weapons systems?”Logistics, Tuttle says, usually falls behind when it comes to innovation. And he should know. Earlier in his career, he was a field artillery officer in the U.S. Army. Later, he served with the Joint Special Operations Command before going on to work at Anduril, where he met his co-founder, ex-Meta software engineer Peter Goldsborough. The two founded Rune after seeing how much modern warfare has changed the scale and pace at which armies have to sustain force.“Ukraine is a sad example of the expenditures of munitions, the consumption of supplies, and those types of things in a near-peer adversary conflict — they will break human-centric and analog-centric processes,” said Tuttle.Rune’s flagship product TyrOS promises to transform manual logistics processes into intelligent supply webs that predict future needs, optimize current resources, and enable distributed operations — even from a disconnected laptop in the middle of the jungle.The startup has just raised a $24 million Series A round off the back of pilot deployments under the U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps. The round — which Human Capital led with participation from Pax VC, Washington Harbour Partners, a16z, Point72 Ventures, XYZ Venture Capital, and Forward Deployed VC — will go toward expanding TyrOS deployment into other U.S. military services.TyrOS has two major selling points. The first is its technical capabilities as a mission command system for logistics. TyrOS relies on deep learning models, including time series models, to forecast supply and demand assets like personnel, transportation, equipment, food, and other resources based on hundreds of environmental and supply variables.Techcrunch eventTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agendaNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

And while LLMs have advanced rapidly, TyrOS still relies on traditional mathematical optimization for certain tasks — like planning aircraft loads based on cubic volume and other constraints — where precise calculations are essential.TyrOS’s second major hook is its edge-first architecture that bypasses the need for constant connectivity to remote servers, allowing the system to operate independently and synchronize when communications are reestablished. In other words, TyrOS is “cloud-capable, but not cloud-required.”“Building software today from a cloud environment standpoint is very different architecturally than if I’m building software to run literally on this laptop in the jungle in the Philippines with Marines or soldiers,” Tuttle said.TyrOS is also cloud- and hardware-agnostic; it can run on program-of-record hardware server stacks that the military uses today for ease of integration, per Tuttle.The co-founder noted that Rune’s backers include executives at both Palantir and Anduril, where he sees plenty of partnership opportunities. Rune was recently selected for the Palantir Startup Fellowship and announ"

    "full_content": "Truecaller is discontinuing its call-recording function on iOS — justover two years after the feature was launched— as the Swedish company opts to focus on its core offering: fighting spam calls.On Friday, the company confirmed to TechCrunch that its call-recording feature will no longer be available on iPhones starting September 30. Users with saved call recordings can either download them to their devices, share them via email or messaging apps, or switch their storage preference to iCloud to keep the recordings accessible even after the feature is discontinued.Truecaller’s head of iOS, Nakul Kabra, told TechCrunch the company took the decision because it wanted to focus on its Live Caller ID and automatic spam-blocking features.In June 2023, Truecaller launched call recording on iOS for its paying subscribers, alongside reintroducing the feature on Android. The app also got support for transcribing calls natively. Both call recording and transcription werelaunchedin India last year.While call recording works seamlessly on Android, it is more complicated on iOS, where Apple’s operating system does not let third-party apps record calls natively. To work around this, Truecaller uses a recording line that merges calls to record — a method that increases both costs and complexity, per Kabra. These challenges ultimately led to the feature being discontinued.The company hasset up a support pageto help users if they face any issues during the transition.Truecaller’s move comes months after Apple introduced native call recording and transcription support for iPhone users in aniOS 18.1 updatelast year. The native feature does not require users to connect to a record line to record the call, unlike Truecaller, and also brings Apple Intelligence-powered transcriptions.Techcrunch eventTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agendaNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

The company plans to offer about 12.5 million shares. Yet existing shareholders will be allowed to cash out of nearly 24.7 million shares,it said.In addition, should this IPO be as hot as everyone thinks it will be, existing shareholders will get the option to sell, collectively, up to 5.5 million more shares.Figma founder CEO Dylan Field has disclosed that he plans to sell 2.35 million shares. At the midrange he’ll be cashing out of over $62 million. (That might be a much higher number if the IPO prices above $28, too.)Even with that sale, he will still own an enormous number of shares and control the company. He will hold 74% of the voting rights after the IPO. This is thanks to supervoting rights of 15 votes per share for the Class B stock he controls, plus the right to vote the Class B shares of his co-founder, Evan Wallace, thecompany says in its S-1.Figma’s biggest venture investors are all cashing out some shares, as well, including Index, Greylock, Kleiner Perkins, and Sequoia. Should the demand be there for the over-allotment, they will cash out 1.7 million to 3.3 million shares apiece. That should allow them to return some cash to their investors in this liquidity-starved venture market.It should be noted, though, that each of these investors is keeping the lion’s share of their Figma holdings. One way to interpret this largely secondary sale is that if the company hadn’t opened up share sales to existing investors, it might not have had enough shares to meet the demand.Techcrunch eventTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agendaNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Should it price above range and exceed that,Figma would be the biggest IPOof 2025 to date. The IPO could happen next week, so we shall soon see. Figma declined further comment."

Blade founder and CEO Rob Wiesenthal will continue to lead the business, which will operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Joby.Blade’s medical division, which transports organs, isn’t included in the transaction and will remain a separate company.The deal gives Joby instant access to a network of 12 terminals in key markets like New York City — notably, a dedicated lounge as well as terminal bases at John F. Kennedy International Airport, Newark Liberty Airport, the West Side of Manhattan, the East Side of Manhattan, and Wall Street.Blade, founded in 2014, doesn’t own a fleet of aircraft. Instead, the company has developed a digital network that allows passengers to book private rides on helicopters across several short-hop routes. The service has grown in popularity as well-heeled customers seek ways to avoid traffic on their commutes from the suburbs into Manhattan, or to The Hamptons for weekends and holidays. The company, which also offers access to routes from Nice, France, to Monaco and Saint-Tropez, flew more than 50,000 passengers in 2024.Joby Aviation founder and CEO JoeBen Bevirt described the deal as a “strategically important” acquisition that will support its launch of its commercial operations in Dubai and subsequent global rollout. The company said it will integrate its software, which is designed to manage air taxi operations, into Blade’s passenger service.Joby, founded in 2009 by Bevirt, has been working for more than a decade to develop, certify, and produce an electric vertical take off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft for commercial taxi service in cities. (The company is also pursuing a separatedefense-related business.)

    "full_content": "AI-powered marketing automation startupConversion, founded five years ago by two UC Berkeley dropouts, has raised a $28 million Series A led by Abstract, with participation from True Ventures and HOF Capital.The company’s founding story sounds like it could have been an episode of the HBO show “Silicon Valley.”The story begins all the way back when co-founder and CEO Neil Tewari, now 24, was in high school. He got busted one day watching a TechCrunch Disrupt livestream during class, was sent to the principal’s office, and had to stay late.Afraid to call his parents and tell them why they had to pick him up, he instead called one of their close friends. On the drive home, Tewari explained to the friend what got him in trouble. “I told him I had this interest [in entrepreneurship], and four years later, he was actually the first person to write us a check into the company,” Tewari told TechCrunch.James Jiao, Tewari’s college roommate at Berkeley — now Conversion’s co-founder and CTO — also dreamed of founding his own company, so the two tried building various products, like one for helping marketeers buy product placement ads. They stumbled on the idea for Conversion when they signed up for HubSpot to help them with marketing tasks and decided to build a few extra automation features to layer on top of it.“It was originally for us,” Tewari said of his startup’s tech. The co-founders enjoyed building their internal marketing tool so much, they wondered if they could sell it and began reaching out to marketing executives for “customer discovery” interviews.“We actually spent like two months doing like 160 customer interviews with VPs of marketing, 50- to 500-employee businesses, and got a much more positive response than we could have imagined,” Tewari said.Techcrunch eventTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agendaNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

The family friend introduced them to more marketing execs, which helped them raise a $2 million seed round. At age 19, they dropped out of college to work full time on Conversion.The founders treated their raised funds so frugally they lived in a two-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment with five other roommates: two people to a room, with people sleeping on the couches and in the closet.As they built their product, ChatGPT burst onto the scene. Many legacy marketing automation tools are adding various AI and chat integrations into their wares, but not all of their features support these integrations. Marketing teams wanted “to be able to enrich contacts, [be] able to automate workflows,” for instance, Tewari said. Conversion has baked AI in, which means it can do things like organize leads and automate personalized follow-up emails.As AI interest has soared, so has the company’s prospects. Conversion is nearing $10 million ARR over the past two years, Tewari said, and about 90% of its customers are midsize businesses that have yanked out a legacy app.Of course, Conversion is also in a crowded field. Besides the legacy marketing automation tools like HubSpot, Adobe Marketo, or Salesforce Pardot, there are other AI native startups likeJasper,Writer AI, Iterable, Copy.ai,and manyothers.But Tewari also has the classic Silicon Valley confidence of a founder in a crowded market. His game plan calls for targeting businesses that use the older marketing tools. Conversion is not, for instance, targeting startups choosing a tool for the first time.The company has raised a total of $30 million between its seed and Series A, the CEO says, and is doing well enough that the founders have each moved into separate apartments where they have their own rooms, and none of their roommates sleep in a closet."

The plan offers subscribers early access to Grok 4 Heavy and other new features, xAI said, but it’s more expensive than comparable plans from other major AI providers, including OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic.It’s interesting to see this demand for Grok’s subscription plans, even though the AI was initiallyconsulting Elon Musk’s X postsfor answers. xAI has sinceaddressedthis issue.Image Credits:AppfiguresInterest in the new model also drove up Grok’s ranking on the U.S. App Store shortly after its launch, making Grok the No. 3 app overall and No. 2 in the Productivity category by July 12.That interest has declined somewhat over the past week — the app is now No. 17 overall — though it’s still No. 2 in Productivity, Appfigures data shows.Appfigures notes that it focused on iOS data for this analysis, as that dataset is currently more comprehensive than data from Android devices.

The network infrastructure giant accused Perplexity of obscuring its identity when trying to scrape web pages “in an attempt to circumvent the website’s preferences,” Cloudflare’s researchers wrote.AI products like those offered by Perplexity rely on gobbling up large amounts of data from the internet, and AI startups have long scraped text, images, and videos from the internet many times without permission to make their products work. In recent times, websites have tried to fight back by using the web standard Robots.txt file, which tells search engines and AI companies which pages can be indexed and which shouldn’t, effortsthat have seen mixed results so far.Perplexity appears to be willingly circumventing these blocks by changing its bots’ “user agent,” meaning a signal that identifies a website visitor by their device and version type, as well as changing their autonomous system networks, or ASN, essentially a number that identifies large networks on the internet, according to Cloudflare.“This activity was observed across tens of thousands of domains and millions of requests per day. We were able to fingerprint this crawler using a combination of machine learning and network signals,” read Cloudflare’s post.Perplexity spokesperson Jesse Dwyer dismissed Cloudflare’s blog post as a “sales pitch,” adding in an email to TechCrunch that the screenshots in the post “show that no content was accessed.” In a follow-up email, Dwyer claimed the bot named in the Cloudflare blog “isn’t even ours.”Cloudflare said it first noticed the behavior after its customers complained that Perplexity was crawling and scraping their sites, even after they added rules on their Robots file and for specifically blocking Perplexity’s known bots. Cloudflare said it then performed tests to check and confirmed that Perplexity was circumventing these blocks.Techcrunch eventTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agendaNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Last month, Cloudflareannounced the launch of a marketplaceallowing website owners and publishers to charge AI scrapers who visit their sites. Cloudflare’s chief executive Matthew Princesounded the alarmat the time, saying AI is breaking the business model of the internet, particularly publishers. Last year, Cloudflare alsolaunched a free toolto prevent bots from scraping websites to train AI.This is not the first time Perplexity is accused of scraping without authorization.Last year, news outlets,such as Wired, allegedPerplexity was plagiarizing their content. Weeks later, Perplexity’s CEO Aravind Srinivaswas unable to immediately answerwhen asked to provide the company’s definition of plagiarism during an interview with TechCrunch’s Devin Coldewey at the Disrupt 2024 conference."

At that time, the firm also announced a $500 million second Select fund, a capital pool for backing late-stage rounds of existing portfolio companies.It’s no surprise that CRV is not raising a late-stage fund as part of its new fundraise. Last year, the firm told The New York Times itwas returning $275 million from its $500 millionSelect fund to investors. The firm explained that it would not be raising another late-stage vehicle because follow-on rounds for many of its companies would lower its overall returns.CRV’s limited partners were eager to back the firm’s smaller fund, the firm said. It raised its entire $750 million fund in just four weeks, with demand for double that amount, CRV wrote.The latest fund will be used to invest in seed and Series A startups and it will focus on backing consumer and devtools companies.CRV is known for leading DoorDash’s seed financing and the Series A rounds for both Mercury and Vercel, a cloud platform for web developers, which was last valued at $3.25 billion.Since its founding in 1970, CRV has backed over 750 startups, with 80 of them eventually going public.Techcrunch eventTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agendaNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

    "full_content": "Weeks after the revelation that Google paid Windsurf $2.4 billion to license its technology, while simultaneously hiring away its CEO and top talent, the deal’s implications are stillrattling some founders and startup employeesacross Silicon Valley.Google’s payment to the startup was effectively split in two equal parts, according to two people familiar with the deal. Investors’ portion was $1.2 billion.The other half was in the form of compensation packages for approximately 40 Windsurf employees hired by the tech giant with a substantial portion of that $1.2 billion going to the startup’s co-founders, Varun Mohan and Douglas Chen, sources say.The transaction was a good outcome for VCs, which included Greenoaks, Kleiner Perkins, and General Catalyst. Windsurf raised a total ofabout $243 millionas of its last raise in 2024 that valued the company at $1.25 billion, which means the total return to investors was about 4x their original funding.Greenoaks, which led Windsurf’s seed and Series A financings and owned 20% of the company, returned about $500 million on their $65 million investment in the startup, according to a person familiar with the matter. Kleiner Perkins, which led Windsurf’s Series B, returned about 3x its invested capital, according to another person familiar with the deal.Google, Kleiner Perkins, and Greenoaks declined to comment. General Catalyst, Varun Mohan, and Douglas Chen didn’t respond to a request for comment.Even so, most investors were aiming for a more significant win from the company.Techcrunch eventTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agendaNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Don’t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech — grab your ticket now and save up to $675 before prices rise.San Francisco|October 27-29, 2025REGISTER NOWIn February, TechCrunch reported that Kleiner Perkins was in talks to lead a fresh round of funding, valuing the startup, which was then known as Codeium, at$2.85 billion. That deal didn’t happen, according to a person familiar with the matter, because Windsurf had instead agreed to be purchased byOpenAI for $3 billion.As we all know now, the OpenAI acquisition unraveled andGoogle swooped inwith its deal structured to offer investor returns and obtain talent and IP without acquiring stock.But what’s rattling the Valley is this: While Google’s deal was good for the co-founders and VCs, it didn’t benefit a large portion of Windsurf’s approximately 250 employees, especially after they were expecting a payout from the sale to OpenAI.In a typical acquisition, employees would get money for the shares they owned and would often havetheir vesting schedule accelerated. However, Windsurf employees who were hired over the last year didn’t receive a payout from the deal, these people said.The Google deal was especially unsettling to approximately 200 Windsurf employees not hired by the search giant.Instead of siphoning every penny of Google’s payment into their own pockets, investors opted to leave the company with over $100 million in capital.One source says this was entirely funded by VCs, meaning their total payout was about $1.1 billion. However, another person said that the founders equally chipped in to leave the company with a nest egg from the Google payment.Multiple people said that the money left for the company would have been sufficient to pay all remaining employees proceeds at the Google deal’s per-share valuation, regardless of how long they had been with the company.  However, to have done that immediately would have been problematic, leaving the company with less cash to operate and — with founders and key people gone — with no investors ready to finance a new raise. The remaining leadership would likely have had to shut down after making such cash distributions, one of the people said. Meanwhile, another person claimed that the company had enough capital to pay out employees and continue to operate.That difference of opinion is only part of the reason the deal became so controversial.What’s more, at least some of the employees Google did hire, despite attractive pay and benefits, saw their stock grants revoked and their vesting timelines restarted. That meant they’d have to wait an additional four years for their total payout in Google stock, according to people familiar with the deal.Some top VCs condemned the 3-year-"
